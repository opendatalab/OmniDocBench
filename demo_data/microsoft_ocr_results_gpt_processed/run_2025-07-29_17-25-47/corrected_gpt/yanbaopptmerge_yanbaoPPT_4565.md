# Retell 1A

Jane:
You look tired, are you okay?

Kangkang:
I have a headache.

Jane:
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

Kangkang:
I watched a movie last night and went to bed very late.

Jane:
Staying up late is bad for your health.

You should go to bed early and you will feel better.

Kangkang:
You must get some rest.

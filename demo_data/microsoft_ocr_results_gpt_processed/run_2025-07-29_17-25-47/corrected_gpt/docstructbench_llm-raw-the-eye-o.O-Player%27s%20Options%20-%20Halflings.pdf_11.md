allows a traveler to walk or ride in the rain or snow
without getting soaked to the bone. Wearers of these
cloaks benefit from conditions similar to that provided
by endure elements, though it only protects from cold
brought on specifically due to exposure to rain and/or
snow.

Occasionally, halflings may make these cloaks for
the "big folk". For anyone larger than a halfling, use the
cost and weight in parentheses.

Halfling Pouch Belt: The halfling pouch belt is a
sturdy but supple leather belt with six leather pouches
sewn to it. Each pouch closes via a brass button, and
each can hold about as much as a standard halfling-
sized pouch. The organization the pouches afford
means items may be retrieved quickly. One item per
round may be accessed as a swift action. Accessing any
other items from the pouches - or placing them in the
pouches - takes a normal move action.

Occasionally, halflings may make these belts for the
"big folk". For anyone larger than a halfling, use the cost
and weight in parentheses.

Halfling Tobacco: Also
known as pipe weed, halfling
leaf or sometimes just leaf,
halfling tobacco has been
perfected over many decades
to be very mild, very sweet
and slow burning.

Halfling Tri-Flute:
The halfling tri-flute may
be a variant or descendant
of the aulos or panpipe,
or it may be
a unique creation
altogether. It consists
of three short wooden

flutes, each of varying lengths, connected with leather
bands. There are four fingerholes on the longest pipe,
three on the shortest and none on the middle pipe. A
single mouthpiece connects to all three pipes.

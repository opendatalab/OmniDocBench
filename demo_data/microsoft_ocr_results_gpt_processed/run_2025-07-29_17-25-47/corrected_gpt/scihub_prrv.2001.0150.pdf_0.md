**KEYWORDS**: gene therapy, modifier gene, polymorphism, primary ciliary dyskinesia, sickle cell, immunodeficiencies, storage diseases, obstructive sleep apnoea, fibrosis, auto-immune.

**Summary**: Epidemiological studies have suggested that many rare diseases with respiratory involvement have a genetic component. Molecular advances have increased the understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases which has led to better diagnostic and prognostic methods. There may be many genes responsible for diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effect of modifier genes. The genotype:phenotype correlation in these diseases remains to be elucidated. In some diseases, such as familial dysautonomia and sickle cell, the gene has been identified which allows for accurate pre-natal testing. Further, in diseases where the genetic abnormality is known, such as chronic granulomatous disease, gene therapy remains a realistic prospect and phase I studies are about to commence or currently underway. This article reviews those rare diseases in which there is or is likely to be a significant genetic contribution. © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd

## INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, there have been great advances in molecular technology. This has enabled further understanding of the molecular pathophysiology and causation of many diseases and the interaction between the host and the environment that influences expression (Fig. 1). In those diseases in which the environment cannot be manipulated, the ultimate hope is to identify and correct the molecular defects or manipulate them in an attempt to overcome the abnormalities they cause. This article examines the genetic contribution in rare diseases that have pulmonary involvement and in which there has been a significant genetic contribution with the potential for future gene therapy.

## THE GENETIC POTENTIAL

The identification of gene defects will lead to a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, should increase diagnostic sensitivity and, by understanding genotype:phenotype correlation, lead to more accurate prognosis. In many diseases, it is likely that there is a genetic influence from modifier genes and understanding more about these genes offers the promise of therapeutic advances. Molecular techniques also help to identify other potential factors which may be implicated in diseases thought previously not to have a genetic predisposition. One such example is respiratory syncytial virus-mediated disease in which a polymorphism of the host interleukin (IL) 8 promoter region has been related to disease severity. Some known genetic contributions to lung disease and its expression are summarised in Table I.

Current attempts at therapeutic measures include overcoming the abnormalities caused by the gene or introducing a functioning gene through gene therapy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the paradigm for gene therapy in respiratory disease. Since the gene was localized, more than 100 patients have received the gene in CF clinical trials.

# 1. 事实推断

这种推断常常针对某一个或几个具体细节,是比较简单的推断,进行这种推断,首先在文章中据以推断的有关文字找出来,加以分析,悟其意思。如:

According to the passage, which of the following can you most possibly watch on TV?

A. You often play football with your friends after school

B. Your teacher has got a cold.

C. A tiger in the city zoo has run out and hasn't been caught.

D. The bike in the front of your house is lost.

在阅读材料中,有这样一段文字:

Secondly, a news story has to be interesting and unusual. People don't want to read stories about everyday life. As a result, many stories are about some kind of danger and seem to be "bad" news.

根据这段文字,我们可以推断:电视报道的新闻故事必须是有趣的和不平常的。答案选C.

# 2. 指代推断

确定代词的含义和指代对象是阅读理解常见题。要确定指代词所指代的对象,关键在于对上下文的正确理解。指代名词的指代词,其单复数形式与被指代的词一致,因此数的形式可作为识别指代对象第一个辅助标志。

## 3. 逻辑推断

这类题目往往是要求根据文章所提供的背景,人物的表情,动作和语言来推断出人物的态度或感觉。

In this work, the harmful effect of triplet excitons on the lifetime of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV)-based organic light emitting diodes is demonstrated. A model system has been designed in which the triplet population in a PPV derivative is increased by blending the polymer with the triplet sensitizer platinum(II) octaethylporphyrin ketone (PtOEPK). The increase in the triplet concentration of the polymer affects both the initial decay and the long-term evolution of luminance and leads to a drastic acceleration of device degradation, reflected in a dramatically shortened lifetime.

## 1 Introduction

Despite the progress made in the field of polymer-based organic light emitting diodes (PLEDs) during the last years, continuing efforts in research are necessary for a substantial breakthrough in commercialization. The lifetime and stability of the devices are still one of the main issues in need of improvement [1-5]. Usually, luminance degradation and an increase in operating voltage with prolonged electrical driving are typical features of electrical fatigue in polymer-based OLEDs [4]. Thereby the device lifetime is normally defined as the $t_{50}$ or half lifetime—the time in which the luminance decreases to 50% from the initial value during operation at constant current.

According to spin statistics, the ratio of singlet to triplet excitons in OLEDs is 1:3. However, differing ratios have been reported for many materials [6-9] but no consensus on the value has been reached. Nevertheless, due to the high lifetime of triplet excitons on the order of several μs to ms [10, 11], high triplet densities are reached in fluorescent devices. The influence of these non-radiatively decaying excitons on the lifetime [12] or efficiency [13-15] of fluorescent OLEDs has been investigated in only few publications. King et al. [12], e.g., reported an increase in the $t_{50}$ lifetime as well as a decrease in the initial luminescence decay in polyfluorene-based OLEDs after reducing the amount of triplets in the polymer matrix by incorporating a triplet quencher additive into the system.

In this contribution, the effect of triplet excitons on the degradation of OLEDs is studied in a PLED in which the polymer is blended with a triplet sensitizer. The presence of the sensitizer leads to the enhancement of the triplet concentration in the matrix semiconductor. The impact of the higher triplet concentration on device lifetime is monitored. As a result, an accelerated degradation due to the increased triplet-to-singlet ratio will be reported.

## 2 Experimental

This study focuses on devices based on the poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivative OC3C8-PPV (poly(2-propoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-phenylene vinylene)), which is used both in pristine state and blended with the triplet sensitizer material platinum(II) octaethylporphyrin ketone (PtOEPK) purchased from Livchem Logistics GmbH. The PLEDs consist of an ITO anode, a PEDOT:PSS hole injection layer (40 nm), an OC3C8-PPV layer (130 nm) and a Ca cathode (20 nm) protected by an Al layer (100 nm).

All devices were fabricated and characterized in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer layers were spin coated.

# What is a Component?

- OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification [OMG01] defines a component as

  - "... a modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system
    that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of
    interfaces."

- OO view: a component contains a set of collaborating
  classes

- Conventional view: a component contains processing
  logic, the internal data structures that are required to
  implement the processing logic, and an interface that
  enables the component to be invoked and data to be
  passed to it.

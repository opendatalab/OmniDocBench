including the sicklefin redhorse sucker.
The petition included supporting
information regarding the species'
taxonomy and ecology, historical and
current distribution, present status, and
actual and potential causes of decline.
In a partial 90-day finding on the
petition to list 404 species, published on
September 27, 2011 (76 FR 59836), the
Service reaffirmed the existing
candidate status of the sicklefin
redhorse sucker.

# Background

The sicklefin redhorse sucker
(Moxostoma sp.), a freshwater fish
species, can grow to a length of
approximately 650 mm (roughly 25.6
in). It has an elongate, somewhat
compressed body and a highly falcate
(sickle shaped) dorsal fin (back fin). Its
body is olive-colored, with a coppery or
brassy sheen; its lower fins (pectoral,
pelvic, and anal fins) are primarily
dusky to dark, often tinted yellow or
orange and pale edged; the caudal fin
(tail fin) is mostly red; and its dorsal fin
is olive in color, sometimes partly red.

Although the sicklefin redhorse
sucker is now known to have been
collected in 1937 (based upon preserved
specimens collected at the then-
unimpounded mouth of Forney Creek
near its confluence with the Tuckasegee
River), it was not recognized as a
potentially distinct species until 1992,
when Dr. Robert Jenkins obtained and
examined two specimens that had been
collected in 1981 and 1982 from the
Little Tennessee River by Dr. Edward
Menhinick (University of North
Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North
Carolina). Based on the characteristics
of the specimens' lower lips, dorsal fins,
and pharyngeal teeth, Jenkins
recognized the species as possibly a
previously unidentified species or a
hybrid of the smallmouth redhorse (M.
breviceps) and the river redhorse (M.
carinatum). Subsequent detailed
morphological and behavioral studies
and genetic studies have concluded that
the sicklefin redhorse sucker is, in fact,
a distinct species. The Service has
reviewed the available taxonomic
literature, and is not aware of any
challenges to the validity of this
conclusion.

The species is currently known to
occupy cool to warm, moderate-gradient
creeks and rivers and, during at least
parts of its early life, large reservoirs. In
streams, adults of the species are
generally associated with moderate to
fast currents, in riffles, runs, and well-
flowing pools, while juveniles show a
preference for moderate to deep pools
with slow currents and large boulder
crevice cover. Adults feed and spawn
over gravel, cobble, boulder, and
bedrock substrates with no, or very
little, silt overlay.

Past and recent collection records of
the sicklefin redhorse sucker, together
with what is known about the habitat
utilization of the species, indicate that
the sicklefin redhorse sucker once
inhabited the majority, if not all, of the
rivers and large creeks in the Blue Ridge
portion of the Hiwassee and Little
Tennessee River systems in North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia.
Currently, there are only two
metapopulations of the sicklefin
redhorse sucker known to remain: One
in the Hiwassee River system and one
in the Little Tennessee River system.
Estimated occupied stream habitat in
the Hiwassee river systems totals about
53.0 river miles (rm). However, use of
various streams/stream reaches within
this total appears to be seasonal.
Available information indicates that the
sicklefin redhorse sucker uses
Brasstown Creek, Hanging Dog Creek,
Beaverdam Creek, Nottely River, and the
mid and upper reaches of the Valley
River, primarily for spawning. No
spawning or courting behavior was
observed within the mainstem of the
Hiwassee River; the mid and lower
Hiwassee River or lower reaches of the
spawning tributaries primarily from the
post-spawning period through the fall
and early winter; or the lower un-
impounded reaches of the Hiwassee
River, and to a lesser extent, the lower
Valley River, during the winter months.

The Little Tennessee River system
metapopulation of the sicklefin redhorse
sucker includes a total of approximately
59.15 rm of creek and river reaches plus
near-shore areas of Fontana Reservoir,
including: (1) The main stem of the
Little Tennessee River in Macon and
Swain Counties, North Carolina,
between the Franklin Dam and Fontana
Reservoir (approximately 23.2 rm), and
its tributaries, Burningtown Creek
(approximately 5.5 rm) and Iotla Creek
(approximately 0.1 rm) in Macon
County, North Carolina; (2) the main
stem of the Tuckasegee River in Swain
and Jackson Counties, North Carolina,
from approximately rm 27.5,
downstream to Fontana Reservoir
(approximately 27.5 rm), and its
tributaries, Forney Creek (mouth of the
creek), Deep Creek (approximately 2.35
rm), and the Oconaluftee River below
the Bryson Dam (also sometimes
referred to as the Ela Dam)
(approximately 0.5 rm), in Swain
County, North Carolina; and (3) sub-
adults in the near shore portions of
Fontana Reservoir, Swain County, North
Carolina.

## Summary of Status Review

In completing our status review, we
reviewed the best available scientific
and commercial information and
compiled this information in the SSA
Report for the sicklefin redhorse sucker.
For our finding, we evaluated potential
stressors related to the sicklefin
redhorse sucker and its habitat. The
stressors we analyzed were: (1)
Hydroelectric operations, inadequate
erosion/sedimentation control during
agricultural, timbering, and construction
activities; (2) runoff and discharge of
organic and inorganic pollutants from
industrial, municipal, agricultural, and
other point and nonpoint sources; (3)
habitat alterations associated with
channelization and instream dredging/
mining activities; (4) predation and
habitat suitability impacts by nonnative
species; (5) fragmentation and isolation
of surviving populations; and (6) other
natural and human-related factors that
adversely modify the aquatic
environment. Associated with the status
review for this 12-month finding, we
conducted an analysis of the Candidate
Conservation Agreement (CCA) for the
Sicklefin Redhorse Sucker under the
Service's Policy for Evaluation of
Conservation Efforts When Making
Listing Decisions (PECE policy),
published in the Federal Register on
March 28, 2003 (68 FR 15100), and
found that the CCA does meet the PECE
policy criteria for certainty of
implementation and certainty of
effectiveness.

A number of factors likely contributed
to a reduction in the species' historical
range and may have affected population
dynamics within the existing occupied
stream reaches. The construction of
hydroelectric dams fragmented
populations, confining spawning
activity only to river reaches accessible
from the two reservoirs where this
species is thought to reside during the
juvenile stage of its life cycle. The
sicklefin redhorse sucker also appears to
be absent from several reaches of
unimpounded river habitat where it was
likely extirpated by degradation of the
habitat or by cold water from
hypolimnetic (deepwater that remains
perpetually cold) discharges or
hydropeaking (releasing frequent, large
discharge pulses of water) for
hydropower production. The
introduction of blueback herring (Alosa
aestivalis) into the habitat occupied by
the sicklefin redhorse sucker was also
considered a potential threat to future
population stability in past candidate
assessments.

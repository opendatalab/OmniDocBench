# Building on the momentum of telehealth

One silver lining of the pandemic is that the US health system
has taken a significant step toward providing a more integrated,
seamless and smarter health care experience (Figure 5). It has
challenged preconceived notions of how health care needs to be
delivered and has eliminated existing barriers to digital health
adoption. Not only have health systems and physicians learned
how to provide remote care, they intend to do it in the future
as an integral part of their service mix. Consumers have seen
firsthand how health technologies can simplify, enhance and
personalize their care experiences, and they will increasingly
demand such care in the future.

Much has been learned about how to integrate and align care
across physical, remote and virtual environments. And more
learnings lie ahead as organizations take necessary steps
to continue the transition to smarter health. This includes
developing shared technical and communications standards;
allowing the permissioned, secure exchange of health
information; and building the capabilities to draw actionable
insights from the vast amounts of structured and unstructured
health data. These technical elements are critical to create the
right data environment for a connected health ecosystem and are
covered in a recent EY paper on health information architecture.

In adapting care to meet patients' needs during the pandemic,
what has ultimately occurred is a shift in long-held beliefs around
what it takes to provide a digital-first health care experience.

- **51% of physicians say** hospital-at-home will be used as an alternative to in-patient care for many conditions
- **61% of consumers say** virtual hospitals will deliver basic medical care through a combination of human interaction, digital consultations, and remote monitoring
- **66% of physicians say** virtual hospitals will deliver basic medical care through a combination of human interaction, digital consultations, and remote monitoring
- **47% of consumers say** virtual presence through a virtual reality headset is a substitute for a health professional being present in person

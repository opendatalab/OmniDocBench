The little person made a bob-curtsey. "Oh, yes, if you please, ma'am; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please, ma'am, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.

"What's that thing?" said Lucie. "That's not my pocket-handkerchief?"

"Oh no, if you please, ma'am; that's a little scarlet waistcoat belonging to Cock Robin!"

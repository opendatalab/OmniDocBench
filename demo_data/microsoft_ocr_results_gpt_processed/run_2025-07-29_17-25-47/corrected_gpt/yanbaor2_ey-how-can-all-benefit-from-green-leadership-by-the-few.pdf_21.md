# 4. Financial institutions must do more to support transition and green innovation

More funding needs to be directed toward green initiatives by the financial services sector. While current financing may be sufficient to satisfy current demand in some parts of the world, total funding requirements for the global transition will rise. Financial institutions have a role to play in promoting demand and facilitating the supply of green money through new green finance products. Working with governments and regulators, they can identify policy and regulatory changes to enable financial product and service innovation, simplify guidelines, harmonize taxonomies, 27 and track green money flows to ensure that transition needs are being met worldwide.

Reallocating capital to low-emission, resilient infrastructure is equally urgent. The financial sector needs to do more to integrate climate impact into investment decisions and to incentivize transparency and disclosure in financial markets.

The green bond market is by far the most developed example of financial services involvement in transition. Worldwide, green bonds worth a record US$269.5 billion were issued in 2020, and new issues worth US$400 billion - US$450 billion are predicted for this year. 28 China is currently the world's second-largest green bond market after the United States, but its sales of green bonds exceeded those in the US in the first quarter of 2021. 29

The Association of British Insurers (ABI) recently announced its Climate Change Roadmap for the insurance and long-term savings industry. 30 The roadmap sets out a plan for making £900 billion (US$1.2 trillion) of investment available to businesses looking to meet net zero targets by 2035. This would amount to £60 billion (US$82 billion) per year and could contribute up to a third of the UK's total finance requirement for reaching its national net zero target.

# 5. Businesses' net zero commitments can be a catalyst for change

Businesses are under increased pressure to develop their own net zero strategies and to demonstrate that their investment decisions, as well as their products and services, are both carbon-efficient and likely to help deliver sustainability goals. As more organizations make that commitment, and ideally accelerate plans in place already, they will stimulate demand for green energy, transport and manufacturing capabilities.

Investing in emerging green technologies may be one way in which they can both demonstrate commitment to reducing their own emissions and also enable nascent technologies to scale. They should also consider how they use green financing, such as sustainability-linked bonds, to fund at least part of their transition plans.

Businesses should help to stimulate consumer demand by prioritizing the development of sustainable products and services that offer an affordable alternative to current ones. EY research has shown consumers are keen to choose green, but cost remains a significant barrier. Companies may also need to partner with financial institutions to help their customers transition to green products and services. Consumers will require new financial products that support the sharing economy, where payment is based on usage rather than owning a product. Households will also need support to take on the initial costs of greening, such as retrofitting a house with more sustainable insulation and replacing fossil fuel heating systems.

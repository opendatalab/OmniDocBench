Chinese investors will start to
understand risk-return, and the
investment time horizons that come
with them. There is a shift, albeit a
slow one, towards more long-term,
solutions-based investing, and foreign
managers should play a key role in this
movement.

Leading foreign managers are investing
substantial resources in educating
retail investors in a vast variety of
investment topics, from retirement to
ESG, through leading digital channels
such as WeChat and Ant Financial.
Foreign managers should leverage
such digital channels to drive investor
education, but can also consider
innovative new channels, such as
providing financial literacy education in
universities and high schools. Financial
literacy remains low worldwide, but
China is known for leapfrogging other
countries when it commits to an idea.
Being a part of the conversation will
give foreign managers a platform to
build their brands.

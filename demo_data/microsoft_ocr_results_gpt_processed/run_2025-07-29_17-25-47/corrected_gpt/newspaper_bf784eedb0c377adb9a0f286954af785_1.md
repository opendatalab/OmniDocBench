# Authority for Conducting the Matching Program

The authority for conducting the matching program is 42 U.S.C. 653(j)(3).

## Purpose(s)

The purpose of the matching program is to provide each participating state agency administering TANF with new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information from OCSE's NDNH system of records to assist them in establishing or verifying TANF applicants' and recipients' eligibility for assistance, reducing payment errors, and maintaining program integrity, including determining whether duplicate participation exists or if the applicant or recipient resides in another state. The state TANF agencies may also use the NDNH information for the secondary purpose of updating the recipients' reported participation in work activities and updating recipients' and their employers' contact information maintained by the state TANF agencies.

## Categories of Individuals

The categories of individuals involved in the matching program are adult members of households who have applied for or receive TANF benefits.

## Categories of Records

The categories of records involved in the matching program, which may include personal identifiers, are new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information. The specific data elements that will be provided to OCSE in a state agency input file are:

- Submitting state code (two-digit Federal Information Processing Standard code)
- Date stamp (input file transmission date)
- Adult TANF caseload month and year of adult TANF applicants and recipients
- Adult TANF applicant/recipient's Social Security number
- Adult TANF applicant/recipient's first, middle, and last name
- Name/Social Security number verification request

Optional:

- Passback data (state agency information used to identify individuals within the input file to be returned on the output file)
- Same state data indicator (indicates whether the state agency requests NDNH new hire, quarterly wage, or unemployment insurance even if the information was provided by that same state)

OCSE will compare the Social Security numbers in the state agency input file to the Social Security numbers in the NDNH, and will provide the state agency with any available new hire, quarterly wage, and available unemployment insurance information in NDNH pertaining to the individuals whose records are contained in the state agency input file. The NDNH data elements that OCSE will return to the state agency are as follows:

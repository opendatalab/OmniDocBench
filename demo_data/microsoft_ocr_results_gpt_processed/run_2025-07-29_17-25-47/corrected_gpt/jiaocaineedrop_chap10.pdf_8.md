39. Physics Suppose that during a storm, the force of the wind blowing against
a skyscraper can be expressed by the vector (115, 20, 18, 0), where each
measure in the ordered triple represents the force in Newtons. What is the
magnitude of this force? (Lesson 8-3)

40. Verify that \(2 \sec^2 x = 1 + \sin x + 1 - \sin x\) is an identity. (Lesson 7-2)

41. A circle has a radius of 12 inches. Find the degree measure of the central
angle subtended by an arc 11.5 inches long. (Lesson 6-1)

42. Find \(\sin 390^\circ\). (Lesson 5-3)

43. Solve \(z^2 - 8z = -14\) by completing the square. (Lesson 4-2)

44. SAT Practice Grid-In If \(x^2 = 16\) and \(y^2 = 4\), what is the greatest possible
value of \((x - y)^2\)?

# CAREER CHOICES

## Meteorologist

![](figures/1.1)

If you find the weather
intriguing, then you
may want to
investigate a career in
meteorology.
Meteorologists spend
their time studying
weather and
forecasting changes in
the weather. They
analyze charts, weather
maps, and other data to make
predictions about future weather patterns.
Meteorologists also research different types
of weather, such as tornadoes and
hurricanes, and may even teach at
universities.

As a meteorologist, you may choose to
specialize in one of several areas such as
climatology, operational meteorology, or
industrial meteorology. As a meteorologist,
you might even be seen on television
forecasting the weather for your area!

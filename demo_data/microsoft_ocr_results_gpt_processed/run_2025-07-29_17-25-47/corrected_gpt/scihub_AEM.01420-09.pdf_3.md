a NCBI clusters of orthologous groups (COG) of proteins.

b Cronobacter sakazakii ES5 BAC 9E10 for mutations within the pigment operon (accession no. AM384990.1).

c NCBI assembly ATCC BAA-894 C. sakazakii complete genome for mutations outside pigment operon (accession no. CP000783.1).

d Closest annotated homolog.

(data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mutant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of growth ($\mu_{\text{max wt}} = 0.14$, $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtX} = 0.22$, $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtE} = 0.24$, and $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtY} = 0.19$; $P = 0.000$).

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing $\Delta crtE$, $\Delta crtX$, and $\Delta crtY$ in LB and M9 medium at 10â„ƒ (for results in M9, see Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, no significant differences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for $\Delta crtY$, $\Delta crtE$, and $\Delta crtX$ in both LB and M9 compared to those of the wild type (in LB, $\mu_{\text{max wt}} = 0.04$, $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtX} = 0.03$, $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtE} = 0.03$, and $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtY} = 0.04$; in M9, $\mu_{\text{max wt}} = 0.01$, $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtX} = 0.01$, $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtE} = 0.01$, and $\mu_{\text{max} \Delta crtY} = 0.01$).

To evaluate growth under acidic conditions, wild-type and mutant strains were tested...

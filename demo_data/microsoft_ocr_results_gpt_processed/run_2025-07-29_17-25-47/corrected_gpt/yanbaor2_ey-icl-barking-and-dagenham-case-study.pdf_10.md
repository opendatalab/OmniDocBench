Gaining staff support is also key to ensuring the tool's continued improvement. Addressing the
challenge of data linkage specifically, Katy Brown said: "We are doing more to communicate to users
why, in some instances, they might not be able to view a record or why it is matched incorrectly
(i.e., conflicting information in different case management systems), which is not the fault of One
View directly. At a high level, this is to try and lift staff understanding of the process and to maintain
trust/understanding in the system."

▶ Clear feedback mechanism: it is important to the project team that improvements to One View are
driven by frontline staff feedback. Jill Gallagher described how this works in practice: "Frontline staff
give us some great narratives around what's going on for them and how the needs have changed
for the people they're serving. We are able to take that information and then adapt One View to meet
that need." This may involve going back to the individual services to address data quality issues:
"We have in some areas gone back to services to address some data quality issues and improve things
from the point of data entry," said Rhodri Rowlands. This was echoed by Katy Brown: "If staff find
information in a case summary they know to be wrong, then we are doing a big push for staff to
report it, so we can look at it in the background and amend."

For example, staff feedback has led to increased frequency of data collection. As described in the
Key challenges section, data is extracted at different frequencies and can be out of date. Debt
information used to be extracted monthly, but LBBD have increased the frequency of these extracts
to weekly based on staff feedback. "We are speaking to staff to identify the priority datasets and do
what we can to increase their frequency and mitigate the impact of 'time' on the data presented,"
said Katy Brown.

▶ Information governance (IG): for the service delivery team, it's been very reassuring to know that
there is robust IG. Gill Wilson describes her confidence in the tool's IG compliance: "One View has
got a very, very good structure to it that embeds the Data Protection Act, the EU's General Data
Protection Regulation, so that you know whenever you go in, you only get access to what is at
your level. The formal process around the data protection, but also the formal process around
the governance structure with the board and everything, it all feeds into the management board.
It's very good. It's very strong."

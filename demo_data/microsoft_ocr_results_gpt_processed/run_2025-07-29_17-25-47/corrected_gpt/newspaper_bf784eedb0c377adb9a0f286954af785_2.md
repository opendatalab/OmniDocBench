U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A) requires Federal
agencies to provide a 60-day notice in
the Federal Register concerning each
proposed collection of information,
including each proposed extension of an
existing collection of information,
before submitting the collection to OMB
for approval. To comply with this
requirement, ACL is publishing a notice
of the proposed collection of
information set forth in this document.

With respect to the following
collection of information, ACL invites
comments on our burden estimates or
any other aspect of this collection of
information, including:

(1) Whether the proposed collection
of information is necessary for the
proper performance of ACL's functions,
including whether the information will
have practical utility;

(2) the accuracy of ACL's estimate of
the burden of the proposed collection of
information, including the validity of
the methodology and assumptions used
to determine burden estimates;

(3) ways to enhance the quality,
utility, and clarity of the information to
be collected; and

(4) ways to minimize the burden of
the collection of information on
respondents, including through the use
of automated collection techniques
when appropriate, and other forms of
information technology.

The Administration for Community
Living (ACL) is requesting approval for
a revised data collection associated with
the Evaluation of the Administration for
Community Living's (ACL) American
Indian, Alaska Natives, and Native
Hawaiian Programs (Older Americans
Act [OAA] Title VI; short title:
Evaluation of the Title VI Programs).
OAA Title VI establishes grants to
Native Americans for nutrition services,
supportive services, and family
caregiver support services. The purpose
of Title VI is "to promote the delivery
of supportive services, including
nutrition services, to American Indians,
Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians
that are comparable to services provided
under Title III" (42 U.S.C. 3057), which
provides nutrition, caregiver and
supportive services to the broader U.S.
population. Title VI is comprised of
three parts; Part A provides nutrition
and supportive services to American
Indians and Alaska Natives, Part B
provides nutrition and supportive
services to Native Hawaiians, and Part
C provides caregiver services to any
programs that have Part A/B.

The evaluation will consist of six data
collection activities: (1) Tribal program
staff interviews; (2) tribal program staff
focus groups, (3) tribal elder focus
groups, (4) tribal elder interviews, (5)
tribal caregiver focus groups, and (6)
follow-up tribal program staff interview.

ACL is requesting to revise the
currently approved data collection
under OMB 0985-0059 by removing the
caregiver survey and adding a follow-up
tribal program staff interview. The
proposed revisions also include
removing annual performance reporting
data elements from the currently
approved IC under OMB 0985-0059 to
the OMB approved Title VI Annual
Performance Report under OMB 0985-
0007.

proposed information collection
request, please visit the ACL website

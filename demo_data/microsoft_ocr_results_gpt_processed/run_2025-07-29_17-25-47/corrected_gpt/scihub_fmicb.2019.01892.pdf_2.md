the groundwater. Based on these measurements, a gradient in
chlorendic acid pollution was observed (Figure 1). In March
2013, 24 4-m long hybrid poplar cuttings of the Grimminge
cultivar [Populus deltoides × (Populus trichocarpa × Populus
deltoides)] were planted on the field for future phytoremediation
purposes. The trees were distributed over a defined rectangular
grid of 10m by 35m, enclosing the area with the highest
concentrations of chlorendic acid in the groundwater (> 100 mg
L^{-1}) (Figure 1). In 2015, samples for isolation of cultivable
fungal strains were collected from soil, rhizosphere and roots
of common bent and hybrid poplar. Four soil samples were
taken in a 1m perimeter around observation wells OW175-4
and OW149-4 (Figure 1), from surface soil, -1, -1.5, and
-2m. Common bent rhizosphere and roots were sampled
inside the 1m perimeter around each of the observation wells.
Poplar rhizosphere and root samples were taken from three trees
growing in the zones with high concentrations of chlorendic acid
(Figure 1). From each tree, four sample repetitions were taken. In
total, 32 soil samples were collected (4 × 4 depths × 2 locations),
8 bentgrass root and rhizosphere samples (4 × 2 locations)
and 12 poplar rhizosphere and root samples (4 × 3 trees). Soil
samples were taken with sterile tools and transported in sterile
bags. Roots were collected with soil particles still adhering to
the surface, which was considered the rhizosphere fraction. For
poplar, the tertiary fine roots were selected. Roots with adhering
rhizosphere fraction were obtained with sterile tools and directly
transferred into falcon tubes with 30ml sterile 10mM MgSO4.


# Isolation of Bacteria and Fungi

Soil samples were homogenized and vortexed in sterile 10mM
MgSO4 prior to isolations. Root and rhizosphere samples were
vortexed after which the roots were removed from the MgSO4.
The resulting soil pellet after centrifugation (15 min, 2700g)
constituted the rhizosphere fraction. Poplar roots were surface

sterilized by immersing them for 5 min in 1% NaClO and
bunchgrass roots were sterilized with 0.1% NaClO supplemented
with 0.1% Tween. Following treatment, all roots were rinsed
four times in sterile distilled water. The last rinsing solution was
plated on 869 medium (Mergeay et al., 1985) to confirm surface
sterility by scoring microbial growth after 7 days of incubation at
30°C. The surface sterilized roots were assembled in 15ml sterile
10mM MgSO4 and mixed for 1 min using a Polytron PR1200
mixer (Kinematica A6).

For fungi isolations, dilutions up to 10^{-4} of the soil,
rhizosphere and endophytic root solutions were plated onto
peptone-glucose-acid-agar medium pH 5, as described by
Dietrich and Lamar (1990), and incubated for 7 days at 23°C.
After incubation, all fungal mycelia were selected, purified and
stored on solid malt extract [2% (w/v)]-peptone [0.3% (w/v)]
medium pH 5 at 4°C.

For bacteria isolation, dilutions of the soil samples were
added to a selective minimal medium (Sebastian et al., 1996)
supplemented with 25 mg L^{-1} chlorendic acid as sole carbon
source, or with 3mM glucose in addition to chlorendic acid.
Every 10 days, 10ml of the culture was transferred into 90ml of
fresh medium with a slightly higher concentration of chlorendic
acid, ultimately leading to 60 mg L^{-1} chlorendic acid after
3 months of incubation at 30°C and 120rpm. At the end of
the experiment, chlorendic acid concentrations were determined
using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The
surviving bacterial strains were purified and stored in a glycerol
solution [15% (w/v) glycerol; 0.85% (w/v) NaCl] at -40°C.


## Identification of Isolated Bacteria and Fungi

DNA was extracted from bacterial isolates using the DNeasy®
Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and from
fungal isolates using the DNeasy® PowerSoil® kit (Qiagen,

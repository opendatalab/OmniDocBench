Each spring requires a 0.4 N force to extend or compress it by 1.0 cm.

(c)
What steady force is needed to move the pointer 2.0 cm from O?
[2]

(d)
What steady acceleration is required to move the pointer in (c)?

The car starts from rest at time $t = 0$ and travels along a straight road. The
accelerometer readings are recorded in Table 14.

Table 14

| Time / s | Acceleration / m/sÂ² |
| - | - |
| 0.00 - 3.00 | 11.00 |
| 3.00 - 4.50 | 7.00 |
| 4.50 - 7.00 | 0.00 |

(e)
How fast is the car travelling after 7.00 s?
[1]

(f)
How far does the car travel in the first 7.00 s?

(g)
Aeroplanes are fitted with three accelerometers as part of their navigation
equipment. Why are three accelerometers needed?

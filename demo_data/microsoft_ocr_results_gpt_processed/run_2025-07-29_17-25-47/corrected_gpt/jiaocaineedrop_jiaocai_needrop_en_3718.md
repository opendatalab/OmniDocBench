![00 word](figures/1.1)

**FLUENCY** is when a child
can see a word and
instantly recognize it.

A child may need to see a word twenty, thirty or
forty times before it becomes "automatic". If a
child has a learning disability, the number of
exposures needed to automatically remember
a word may go up to well over a hundred.

Tests have shown that children have about
ten seconds of "working memory" - if a child
can read a sentence in ten or less seconds,
he/she can "get" (comprehend) the "big idea"
of the sentence.

If a child has to struggle to read each word
in a sentence, by the time the child reaches
the end of the sentence, he/she has forgotten
the words at the beginning of the sentence =
zero comprehension.

There are 220 "high frequency" words
that make up 50 - 70% of almost all written
sentences.

If a child can automatically read these words,
then a child has a better chance of reading a
sentence in ten seconds or less - and this
leads to a happier, less frustrated reader

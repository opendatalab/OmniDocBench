# Background

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act (16
U.S.C. 1533) requires that, within 12
months after receiving any petition to
revise the Federal Lists of Endangered
and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that
contains substantial scientific or
commercial information indicating that
listing an animal or plant species may
be warranted, we make a finding ("12-
month finding"). In this finding, we
determine whether listing the
Huachuca-Canelo population of the
Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter,
black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle,
Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirstii (Hirst
Brothers' panic grass), two Kentucky
cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and
Tatum Cave beetle), relict leopard frog,
sicklefin redhorse sucker, and Stephan's
riffle beetle is: (1) Not warranted; (2)
warranted; or (3) warranted, but the
immediate proposal of a regulation
implementing the petitioned action is
precluded by other pending proposals to
determine whether species are
endangered or threatened species, and
expeditious progress is being made to
add or remove qualified species from
the Federal Lists of Endangered and
Threatened Wildlife and Plants
("warranted but precluded"). Section
4(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that we
treat a petition for which the requested
action is found to be warranted but
precluded as though resubmitted on the
date of such finding, that is, requiring a

subsequent finding to be made within
12 months. We must publish these 12-
month findings in the Federal Register.


## Summary of Information Pertaining to the Five Factors

Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533)
and the implementing regulations in
part 424 of title 50 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (50 CFR part 424)
set forth procedures for adding species
to, removing species from, or
reclassifying species on the Federal
Lists of Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife and Plants. The Act defines
"endangered species" as any species
that is in danger of extinction
throughout all or a significant portion of
its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(6)), and
"threatened species" as any species that
is likely to become an endangered
species within the foreseeable future
throughout all or a significant portion of
its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(20)). Under
section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may
be determined to be an endangered or a
threatened species because of any of the
following five factors:

(A) The present or threatened
destruction, modification, or
curtailment of its habitat or range;

(B) Overutilization for commercial,
recreational, scientific, or educational
purposes;

(C) Disease or predation;

(D) The inadequacy of existing
regulatory mechanisms; or

(E) Other natural or manmade factors
affecting its continued existence.

We summarize below the information
on which we based our evaluation of the
five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of
the Act to determine whether the

Huachuca-Canelo population of the
Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter,
black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle,
Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirstii, two
Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave
beetle and Tatum Cave beetle), relict
leopard frog, sicklefin redhorse sucker,
and Stephan's riffle beetle meet the
definition of an endangered or
threatened species. More detailed
information about these species is
presented in the species-specific
assessment forms found on http://
www.regulations.gov under the
appropriate docket number (see
ADDRESSES, above).

In considering what stressors under
the Act's five factors might constitute
threats, we must look beyond the mere
exposure of the species to the factor to
determine whether the species responds
to the factor in a way that causes actual
impacts to the species. If there is
exposure to a factor, but no response, or
only a positive response, that factor is
not a threat. If there is exposure and the
species responds negatively, the factor
may be a threat. In that case, we
determine if that stressor rises to the
level of a threat, meaning that it may
drive or contribute to the risk of
extinction of the species such that the
species warrants listing as an
endangered or threatened species as
those terms are defined by the Act. This
does not necessarily require empirical
proof of a threat. The combination of
exposure and some corroborating
evidence of how the species is likely
affected could suffice. The mere
identification of stressors that could
affect a species negatively is not
sufficient to compel a finding that

## Reading - Never Give Up

Dear Zhang Wei,

I want to tell you about something amazing that I read. A blind man climbed
Mt. Qomolangma! Can you believe it? I'm still surprised at this.

Eric Weihenmayer has been blind since he was 13. However, that has never
stopped him from doing amazing things. After he became blind, he started mountain
climbing.

Most mountain climbers need to use their eyes to climb mountains. How can
Eric do this without using his eyes? Well, Eric climbs by feeling with his hands and
listening to the sounds around him. Eric always climbs with his friends. They wear
special jackets with hanging bells, and he follows the sounds made by the bells.

After training hard for many years, Eric decided to climb Mt. Qomolangma.
Mountain climbing experts were very amazed when they heard this. The mountain
called Qomolangma is very difficult to climb. Many people tried to climb it, but
failed. The experts said he couldn't do it, but Eric wasn't worried.

His friends weren't worried, either. They started the challenging climb. They
climbed for 48 tiring days. On the last day of the climb, they couldn't start until 9 p.m.
because of bad weather. Climbing in the dark was challenging for Eric's friends, but
it wasn't for Eric. Due to his blindness, he has been climbing that way his whole
life. In the end, they reached the top of Mt. Qomolangma. They were very proud of
themselves. Instead of feeling tired, they were very happy!

We should never give up our dreams!

Your friend,
Susan

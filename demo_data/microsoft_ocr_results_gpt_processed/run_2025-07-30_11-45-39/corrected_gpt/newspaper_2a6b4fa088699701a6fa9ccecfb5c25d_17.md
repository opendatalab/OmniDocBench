Madera Canyon. Stephan's riffle beetle
is no longer found at the Bog Springs
Campground location, as the habitat
there no longer exists. Stephan's riffle
beetle has not been collected or
documented since 1993, despite the
Service's surveying for the species at the
one remaining known location,
Sylvester Spring, and at numerous other
nearby locations with potential habitat.
Based on our review of the best
available scientific and commercial
information, we believe that the
Stephan's riffle beetle is extinct.

The preponderance of Stephan's riffle
beetle specimens have been
documented in artificial habitat created
by a water tank's leaking pipeline and
overflow at the Bog Springs
Campground. Only two specimens have
ever been documented from Sylvester
Spring, the only relatively intact spring
habitat remaining where the species was
known to exist. Historically, Stephan's
riffle beetle may have only occupied
Sylvester and Bog Springs, and
populations may have started declining
when water from springs in Madera
Canyon was first captured in concrete
boxes and piped to divert water for
domestic and recreational water
supplies. Up until 1993, when
Stephan's riffle beetle was last detected,
the species appears to have existed only
in extremely low numbers within
Sylvester Spring, making it very
difficult to detect, in contrast to the
relatively large numbers collected in
1979 at the Bog Springs Campground
site. The species has not been
documented as extant since 1993, 23
years ago, when one individual was
found at Sylvester Spring as part of a
specific effort to survey for Stephan's
riffle beetle in Madera Canyon.

Beginning in 2012, the Service
surveyed Sylvester Spring, the one
remaining known population location
for Stephan's riffle beetle, and seven
other locations with potential habitat on
multiple occasions. The most intensive
survey efforts occurred at Sylvester
Spring and Bog Springs, the water
source for the extirpated Bog Springs
Campground population. Three
different survey methods were used in
an effort to find the species, and no
Stephan's riffle beetles were found.
While Stephan's riffle beetle is small in
size (and therefore difficult to find),
adult beetles, if present, should be
detected regardless of the time of year
surveyed based on their life history
(multi-year metamorphosis and
relatively long life span). Therefore,
based on the best available scientific
and commercial information, the
Service believes Stephan's riffle beetle
to be extinct.


# Summary of Status Review

The SSA Report for Stephan's riffle
beetle is a summary of the information
assembled and reviewed by the Service
and incorporates the best available
scientific and commercial information
for this species. Our analysis leads us to
believe Stephan's riffle beetle is extinct.
Species extinction is difficult, if not
impossible, to prove, and the Service
has no policy specifically defining the
level of information necessary to
conclude that a species should be
considered extinct. For any species
there is uncertainty in drawing a
conclusion of extinction. For the
Stephan's riffle beetle, we have carefully
assessed the best scientific and
commercial information available
regarding the current status of the
species. The biological information we
reviewed and analyzed as the basis for
our findings is documented in the SSA
Report. Our analysis of this information
found that there has been no
confirmation of the existence of the
Stephan's riffle beetle in more than 23
years, despite multiple survey efforts
since 2012 in known and potential
habitat where other riffle beetles were
documented, across multiple seasons,
and using a variety of survey methods.

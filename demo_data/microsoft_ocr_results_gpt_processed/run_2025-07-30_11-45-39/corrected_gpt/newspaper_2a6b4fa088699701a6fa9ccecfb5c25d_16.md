Resources Commission, Duke Energy
Carolinas, Eastern Band of Cherokee
Indians, Tennessee Valley Authority,
and Georgia Department of Natural
Resources. A primary goal of the CCA is
to expand the range of this species
upstream of barrier dams to repopulate
stream reaches that were formerly
degraded, but currently appear suitable.
Expanding the range of the sicklefin
redhorse sucker into the upper sections
of these watersheds will provide a
greater variety of available habitat,
allowing the species to more easily
adjust to temporary effects of
construction and landscape alteration.
and providing more opportunities to use
areas of refuge during periods of adverse
conditions, such as periods of high
temperature or increased flow.
Accessibility to more suitable habitat
will increase the number of available
spawning sites, increasing the
opportunities for successful
recruitment, and will provide
alternative spawning areas should some
spawning sites become unsuitable.
Successful reintroduction will increase
the carrying capacity of the sicklefin
redhorse sucker by providing the
species with additional riverine habitat
as well as access to additional reservoirs
to serve as juvenile rearing habitat. The
SSA Report for the sicklefin redhorse
sucker noted that threats [i.e., factors
affecting the species) could be
exacerbated by climate change or
interaction among the threats. However,
the SSA Report's evaluation of all of the
threats facing this species indicates that
the existing populations are stable and
are likely to remain stable in most of the
plausible future scenarios. In addition,
while populations are currently stable
and likely to remain so, under the CCA's
management framework, the parties will
work collaboratively to address threats
in a way that reduces the likelihood that
they will negatively affect the future
viability of the species.

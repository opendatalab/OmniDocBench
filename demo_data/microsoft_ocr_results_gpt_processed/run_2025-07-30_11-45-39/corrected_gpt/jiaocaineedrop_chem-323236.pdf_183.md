# 5.8: Naming Molecular (Covalent) Compounds


## Learning Objectives

· Determine the name of a simple molecular compound from its chemical formula.


### Molecular Compounds

Molecular compounds are inorganic compounds that take the form of discrete molecules. Examples include such familiar
substances as water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). These compounds are very different from ionic compounds like sodium
chloride (NaCl). Ionic compounds are formed when metal atoms lose one or more of their electrons to nonmetal atoms. The
resulting cations and anions are electrostatically attracted to each other.

So what holds the atoms of a molecule together? Rather than forming ions, the atoms of a molecule share their electrons in such a
way that a bond forms between a pair of atoms. In a carbon dioxide molecule, there are two of these bonds, each occurring
between the carbon atom and one of the two oxygen atoms.


Figure 5.8.1: Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a central carbon atom bonded to 2 oxygen atoms.

Larger molecules can have many, many bonds that serve to keep the molecule together. In a large sample of a given molecular
compound, all of the individual molecules are identical.


#### Naming Binary Molecular Compounds

Recall that a molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element that a molecule contains. A molecule of water contains
two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, so its formula is H2O. A molecule of octane, which is a component of gasoline,
contains 8 atoms of carbon and 18 atoms of hydrogen. The molecular formula of octane is C8H18.


Figure 5.8.2: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown toxic gas that is a prominent air pollutant produced by internal
combustion engines.

Naming binary (two-element) molecular compounds is similar to naming simple ionic compounds. The first element in the formula
is simply listed using the name of the element. The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding
the suffix -ide. A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule. Table 5.8.1 lists these
numerical prefixes.


Table 5.8.1: Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds

| Number of Atoms in Compound | Prefix on the Name of the Element |
| - | - |
| 1 | mono-* |
| 2 | di- |
| 3 | tri- |
| 4 | tetra- |
| 5 | penta- |
| 6 | hexa- |

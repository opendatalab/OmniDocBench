![Risk Likelihood Impact Vulnerability Threat Capability Opportunity Intent](figures/1.1)


In the cyber domain, just as in all domains, there are various factors that go into assessing risk. Risk Assessment can be viewed as a
function with inputs, a process, and outputs. In general risk is viewed as a function of likelihood of occurrence of an
event and impact of an event, risk(likelihood, impact).

Intuitively, if we increase the likelihood of a negative event occurring, the risk severity increases, and vice versa. This is also the
case with impact, if the impact of a negative event occurring increases, the risk severity increases.


# Likelihood of Occurrence

Likelihood of occurrence can be decomposed into two main components: threat and vulnerability. Threat is any circumstance or
event that has the potential to adversely impact our system. Threat can be adversarial (purposely caused by a person) or non-
adversarial (caused by an accident or natural event such as a hurricane). Vulnerability represents a weakness in an information
system that can be exploited, often by an adversarial threat actor.

Not all vulnerabilities are equal, there are factors that we can assess a vulnerability with. The risk assessment team will ask and
answer questions such as (OWASP):

· (Discoverable) How easy is it for an adversary to discover the vulnerability?

• (Exploitable) How easy is it for an adversary to exploit the vulnerability?

· (Awareness) How well known is the vulnerability?

· (Detectable) How likely is an exploit to be detected?

Just as with vulnerabilities, threats are also assessed using various factors. The risk assessment team will ask and answer questions such
as (OWASP):

• (Capability) How technically skilled is an adversary?

· (Capability) How much does the adversary know about the target system?

· (Opportunity) Does the adversary have the resources (technology) to exploit a vulnerability?

· (Opportunity) Is the adversary in a position to exploit a vulnerability?

· (Intent) How motivated is an adversary to find and exploit a vulnerability?

• (Intent) Does the actor performing the exploit intend harm?

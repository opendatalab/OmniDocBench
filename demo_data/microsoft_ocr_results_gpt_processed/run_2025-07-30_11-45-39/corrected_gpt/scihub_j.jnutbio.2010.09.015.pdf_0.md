## Abstract

Lactoferrin has been associated with insulin sensitivity in vivo and in vitro studies. We aimed to test the effects of lactoferrin on human subcutaneous and
visceral preadipocytes. Human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes were cultured with increasing lactoferrin (hLf, 0.1, 1, 10 μM) under differentiation
conditions. The effects of lactoferrin on adipogenesis were studied through the expression of different adipogenic and inflammatory markers, AMPK activation
and Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) activity. The response to insulin was evaluated through Ser473AKT phosphorylation. In both subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes,
lactoferrin (1 and 10 μM) increased adipogenic gene expressions and protein levels (fatty acid synthase, PPARγ, FABP4, ADIPOQ, ACC and STAMP2) and
decreased inflammatory markers (IL8, IL6 and MCP1) dose-dependently in parallel to increased insulin-induced Ser473AKT phosphorylation. In addition to these
adipogenic effects, lactoferrin decreased significantly AMPK activity (reducing pThr172AMPK and pSer79ACC) and RB1 activity (increasing the pSer807/811RB1/RB1
ratio). In conclusion, these results suggest that lactoferrin promotes adipogenesis in human adipocytes by enhancing insulin signaling and inhibiting RB1 and
AMPK activities.

## 1. Introduction

Adipose tissue is recognized as an endocrine organ that plays an
important role in human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer.
Adipogenesis can be divided in two stages: adipocyte commitment of
multipotent stem cells and terminal differentiation to mature
adipocytes. Adipocyte commitment under tissue culture conditions
is achieved by cell confluency. Cells under high confluency can be
further induced to become mature adipocytes by various adipogenic
inducers. Transcriptional pathways important for the later stages of
adipogenesis have been extensively studied. In particular, several key
transcription factors such as PPARγ and members of the C/EBP protein
family play pivotal roles in dictating cascades of transcriptional
activation required for establishing the terminally differentiated state
[1,2]. The negative effects of inflammatory mediators on adipocyte

differentiation has been extensively reported [3,4], leading to
concomitant blunting of insulin action.

Lactoferrin is a pleiotropic glycoprotein (80 kDa) and a prominent
component of the first line of mammalian host defense, acting on
specific lactoferrin receptors that exist in a variety of cells, like
monocytes, lymphocytes and adipocytes [5]. Its expression is up-
regulated in response to inflammatory stimuli [5]. Lactoferrin is able
to bind and buffer several pathogen-associated molecular patterns
such as lipopolysaccharide, viral components and soluble compo-
nents of the extracellular matrix [6]. This ability is associated with the
putative lactoferrin anti-inflammatory activity, as demonstrated in
several studies [7-10]. Lactoferrin also participates in the regulation of
cellular growth and differentiation [11,12]. In primary osteoblasts,
lactoferrin stimulated proliferation and differentiation and acted as a
survival factor, activating PI3 kinase-dependent AKT signaling,
inhibiting apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and inhibiting
osteoclastogenesis in a murine bone marrow culture [13]. Recently,
we have reported that lactoferrin is associated with insulin sensitivity
in vivo in humans and in vitro (increasing Ser473AKT phosphorylation)
in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cell lines. We also showed that lactoferrin
inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cell line through the increase of
AMPK and Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) activity [14,15].

Lactoferrin is found in considerable concentrations in breast milk
(1 mg/ml) and in colostrum (7 mg/ml). LF is a natural component of
breast milk which is ingested by infants. Lactoferrin administration in

aMaximum protection, 37.5%.

bMaximum protection, 50.0%.


'Maximum protection, 62.5%.

AED, antiepileptic drug; MES, maximal electroshock; TD50, the dose eliciting evidence of minimal neurotoxicity in 50% of animals; CI, confidence interval; ED50, the dose of drug
required to produce the desired end point in 50% of animals; and PI, protective index (ratio of TD50 to ED50).

Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal
administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced
clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide
\>\> valproate = ethosuximide >> phenytoin (Table 1).
Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of 300 mg/kg. In
slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant
potency in this test with oral administration in mice was
phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide >> valproate
$> > >$ phenytoin (Table 2).

Oral rufinamide $\left( \geq 1,000 \mathrm { mg / kg } \right)$ and phenytoin (800
mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures
in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticon-
vulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.


# Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic
doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure
tests (ED50 ~50-75 mg/kg) and showed partial protec-
tion from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.5% pro-
tection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency
in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbi-
tal ≥ rufinamide >> valproate = ethosuximide > pheny-
toin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test,
phenytoin had the lowest $\mathrm { E D } _ { 5 0 }$ value, suggesting the great-
est potency. However, it is important to note that 50% pro-
tection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Pheny-
toin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and
picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.


## Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide
$\left( \mathrm { T D } _ { 5 0 } \right)$ in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was
500-1,000 mg/kg. The $\mathrm { T D } _ { 5 0 }$ for rufinamide was higher
than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a
lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not as-
sessed due the low $\mathrm { E D } _ { 5 0 }$ values and high protective index
$\left( > 40 \right)$ .

Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperi-
toneal rufinamide (1,000 mg/kg, $n = 2$ ; $\mathrm { E D } _ { 5 0 }$ 15-100
mg/kg) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle
relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal
died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the com-
parator drugs induced increased side effects $\left( 2 \times \mathrm { T D } _ { 5 0 } \right)$
and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-24 h $\left( { } ^ { 0 S } \mathrm { Q L } \times { } ^ { \sharp } { } ^ { \sharp } \right)$ .
The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice $\left( \mathrm { T D } _ { 3 } / \mathrm { E D } _ { 9 7 } > 19.2 \right.$
[intraperitoneal] and $> 23.8$ [oral]) was consistently greater
than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required
to produce loss of righting reflex in mice $\left( \mathrm { H D } _ { 5 0 } \right)$ was
$> 500$ and <1,000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a nu-
merically greater $\mathrm { H D } _ { 5 0 }$ value than phenytoin or phenobar-
bital $\left( \mathrm { H D } _ { 5 0 } \right.$ values of 178 and 135 mg/kg, respectively).
Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable

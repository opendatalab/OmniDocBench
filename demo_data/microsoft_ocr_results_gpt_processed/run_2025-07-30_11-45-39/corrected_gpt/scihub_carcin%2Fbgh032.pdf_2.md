gene expression between samples was calculated through the inclusion of a
cDNA dilution series of a reference sample, amplified with each primer set
separately. In order to account for RNA loading differences between samples,
the measured gene expression was normalized against β-actin expression. The
t-test was used to assign statistical significance.


# NF-κB reporter system

The ability of DCA to activate NF-κB was investigated using a luciferase
reporter system in which the luciferase gene was under the control of a NF-κB
dependent promoter (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). In short, the OE33 cells
were seeded in triplicate into 6 well tissue culture flasks and the NF-κB
luciferase plasmid was transfected into them using the GeneJammer transfec-
tion reagent (Stratagene). Initial experiments validated the transfection using
a supplied positive control for NF-κB activity. The cells were then either
exposed to DCA for varying periods of time (0-4 h) or remained untreated.
After exposure, the cells were processed following the manufacturer's recom-
mendations to release the luciferase enzyme and the subsequent luciferase
expression was quantified with the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system
(Promega, Southampton, UK). Resulting luminescence was measured using a
luminometer (Anthos Labtech Instruments, Salzburg, Austria). Fold increases
were calculated based on the background luminescence of the untreated cells
(untreated cells were set up for each time point analysed). The t-test was used
to evaluate differences between the triplicate readings from treated and
untreated cells.


## Results


### DCA specifically switches on IkB and IL-8

RNA extracted from untreated OE33 cells and OE33 cells
treated for 24 h with 300 μM DCA at pH 7, was analysed
using five different pathway specific membrane arrays. By far
the most prominent of the DCA induced gene expression
changes were the switching on of IkB and IL-8. As IkB and
IL-8 are transcriptional targets of NF-κB, this suggests activa-
tion of NF-κB by DCA (as is demonstrated below). As shown
in Figure 2, using a cancer pathway array and a signal trans-
duction array, both IkB and IL-8 are substantially up-regulated
24 h after DCA treatment. Figure 2 also shows a number of
other changes in gene expression 24 h after DCA treatment
(mostly up-regulation), these (and other changes noted from
other arrays) are documented in Table I.

The gene expression alterations listed in Table I from the five
different arrays used, have been grouped into four separate groups
based on the function of the genes involved. As IL-8 (29) and
IkB (30) have previously been suggested to be transcriptional

This table contains a list of genes whose expression was consistently altered
after exposure to DCA. By consistent, we mean that the expression change
was evident on both duplicate array experiments (although no real-time PCR
data available). In the right hand column is the time point at which the
expression change was evident. The arrows in the central column reflect
the relative strength of the expression changes.


Fig. 2. Membrane array analysis of DCA treated OE33 cells, 24 h post-exposure. (a) Cancer pathway arrays were used to study gene expression abnormalities
induced by 300 μM DCA relative to untreated OE33 cells. These example arrays show the up-regulation of the IkB and IL-8 genes by DCA. (b) Two example
signal transduction arrays are shown; those hybridized with cDNA from untreated OE33 cells and cDNA from OE33 cells 24 h after DCA exposure.
A number of other genes are up-regulated by DCA, particularly evident in the cancer pathway array in (a). These genes (and others) are identified in Table I.

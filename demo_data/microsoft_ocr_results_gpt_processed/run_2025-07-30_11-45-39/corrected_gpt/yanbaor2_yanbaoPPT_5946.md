# Exhibit 1 In 2017, consumers felt better about their finances, leading to more trading up and less trading down.

Still moving away from the middle
Consumers continue to either trade up or trade
down, moving away from midmarket brands.
Although globally the trade-up trend is slightly
stronger than the trade-down trend, the survey
results show vast differences at the country level.
Last year, when we saw a marked increase in
trade-up behavior among Indian consumers, we
predicted a continuation of that trend-driven
largely by rapid urbanization, the expansion of
modern retail outlets, and premiumization in
several CPG categories including beauty products,
beverages, and packaged food. Indeed, the latest
survey shows that India had the highest trade-up
rate, at 25 percent (Exhibit 2).

Turkey and China, too, had trade-up rates of 20
percent or higher. Turkish consumers have been
active up-traders over the past two years. In the
2016 the latest figure is, unsurprisingly, down
slightly, due to tougher economic conditions in
Turkey. In China, gains in consumer confidence
have led to increases in discretionary spending.3
A mere 2 percent of Chinese consumers said they
traded down.

In some Latin American and African countries, on
the other hand, trade-down rates were upward of
20 percent, whereas trade-up rates were in the
single digits. Consumer companies should note
that in these developing economies, down-traders
often opted for lower-priced branded products
rather than retailers' private-label products. Take
nonalcoholic beverages, for instance: only 19
percent of down-traders in Latin America said they
switched to private-label products in this category,
whereas in North America, 73 percent of down-
traders did so. We observed the same pattern in
a number of other CPG categories, including food
and household products. CPG manufacturers
should therefore consider launching- and
aggressively marketing-branded products in
entry-level price tiers in these countries.

### What it means to be thrifty

The most prevalent changes in spending behavior
varied greatly by country. Even among consumers
who sought to save money, the preferred methods
for doing so weren't necessarily the same from
one country to the next.

In many countries, including the United States,4
39 percent of those who reported a change in
buying behavior said they still buy their preferred
brands but at stores with lower prices. Compared
with 2015, fewer US consumers said they waited
for discounts or clipped coupons, suggesting that
US bargain hunters, once they've found a cheaper
retailer, begin to spend more freely at that retailer.
This trend underscores the importance of channel
strategy for CPG companies: they need to build a
strong presence in channels that are perceived as
low priced, such as club stores, discounters, and
certain online retailers.

"Who are you?" said Lucie. "Have you seen my
pocket-handkins?"

The little person made a
bob-curtsey - "Oh, yes, if you
please'm; my name is Mrs.
Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you
please'm, I'm an excellent
clear-starcher!" And she
took something out of a
clothes-basket, and spread
it on the ironing-blanket.

"What's that thing?" said Lucie - "that's not my
pocket-handkin?"

"Oh no, if you please'm;
that's a little scarlet waistcoat
belonging to Cock
Robin!"

And she ironed it and
folded it, and put it on one
side.

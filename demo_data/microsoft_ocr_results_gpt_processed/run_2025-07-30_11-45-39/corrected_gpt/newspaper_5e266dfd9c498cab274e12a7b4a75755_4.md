The regulation provides that all other
use, absent statutory or other express
authority, requires a sales contract or
permit. The BLM refers interested
parties to the explanation of this
regulatory language in the preamble to
the final rule published in the Federal
Register in 2001, available at https://
www.federalregister.gov/d/01-29001,
which states that minimal use "would
not include large-scale use of mineral
materials, even within the boundaries of
the surface estate" (66 FR 58894).
Further explanation is contained in the
BLM Instruction Memorandum No.
2014-085 (April 23, 2014), available on
the BLM's website at https://
www.blm.gov/policy/im-2014-085.

the Farmington Mancos-Gallup RMP
Amendment is terminated immediately.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969, as implemented by the
Council on Environmental Quality
regulations, the BLM announced its
intent to prepare an RMP Amendment
and associated EIS on February 25, 2014
(79 FR 10548). On October 21, 2016, the
BLM and the BIA published an

amended Notice of Intent in the Federal
Register announcing the addition of the
BIA as a joint/co-lead agency for the EIS
(81 FR 72819). The purpose of the EIS
was to analyze the impacts of additional
oil and gas development within the San
Juan Basin in northwestern New

Mexico, as well as decisions related to
lands and realty. BLM-managed lands
with wilderness characteristics, and
vegetation management. The EIS was
also to evaluate alternatives and issues
related to the BIA's authority over
mineral leasing and associated activity
decisions on Navajo Tribal Trust Lands
and Navajo Indian allotments. The
Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS
published in the Federal Register on
February 28, 2020 (85 FR 12012). The
bureaus distributed the Draft EIS to
various Federal, State, and local
agencies, elected officials, special
interest groups, interested individuals,
and the media. Due to the COVID-19
pandemic and restrictions placed on in-
person meetings, virtual public hearings
were held on May 14, 15, 16, and 18,
2020, as well as on August 26, 27, 28,
and 29, 2020. Since the initial
publication of the Notices of Intent in
2014 and 2016, and the publication of
the draft RMP Amendment and EIS in
2020, there have been many changes
relevant to the plan amendment and
associated EIS, such as a change in the
development trends in the San Juan
Basin; the withdrawal of 336,404 acres
from mineral entry around the Chaco
Culture National Historical Park; the
preparation of BIA-funded ethnographic
studies for the region; the establishment
of the Honoring Chaco Initiative; and an
increase in outdoor recreation in the
region. Given these changes and the
extent of revisions necessary to address
these changes in the current EIS
process, the agencies determined it is
impractical to continue the plan
amendment effort as currently
structured. Therefore, the BLM and BIA
hereby terminate preparation of the EIS
for the RMP Amendment.

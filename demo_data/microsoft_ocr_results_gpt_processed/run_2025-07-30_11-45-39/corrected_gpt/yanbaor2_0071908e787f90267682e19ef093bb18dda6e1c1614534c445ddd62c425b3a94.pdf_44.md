Our platform basically captures the
prescriptive logic that experts apply to
all known sales, service and operational
decisions and allows it to be replicated
in a very compliant and predictable way.
And that means that banks and insurers
can take the risk out of the customer
conversation so that employees can
instead focus on delivering a truly valuable
experience.


# DM: How has that impacted the workforce?

RF: It has actually been incredibly
empowering. The reality is that front-line
staff want to be helping customers and
want to be delivering a better experience.
But many of them are so afraid of the risks
or so confused by the formulas that they
fall short of actually helping customers.

With our solution, no matter what
question a customer asks, the employee
will be able to quickly consider the right
factors, ask the right questions and then
offer the right products or solutions.
They don't need to confer with trained
specialists because the logic used by
those specialists is already embedded
in the system. It also means staff can be
performing in a fully compliant way with a
fraction of traditional training.


## DM: What feedback have you received from banks and insurers?

RF: We have helped banks and insurers
achieve some amazing results. We helped
one bank achieve a 52 percent increase in
sales closures within the branch with a
20 percent increase in cross sales. We
have helped insurers build virtual advisors
that have allowed them to target services
to small-to-medium enterprises. And
we've helped a number of financial

services organizations improve their first
call resolution rates in their call centers.
We are also now helping turn current
Virtual Assistants into Virtual Advisors,
powered by our logic.

But I think the greatest feedback we get is
from the employees themselves. We've
seen performance rates go through the
roof, largely because employees are being
allowed to really focus on their customers.
And that has made a measurable
difference in both customer and employee
engagement.


### DM: How does your solution integrate into the omni-channel approach?

RF: We are the platform that enables
these omni-channel technologies to
deliver a consistent, compliant and needs-
based experience to customers. Our VA
logic can be used to navigate staff through
all known customer engagements in
line with the latest regulatory, procedural
and product rules - before handing over
to the existing operating systems for
execution.

The natural starting point for our platform is
often within the contact center - helping
turn agents into Super Agents who can
answer any call they receive. From there
we very seamlessly integrate into the digital
architecture and operating systems of the
organization to help them deliver a true
omni-channel experience that is consistent,
compliant and customer focused.

Perhaps the best part about the solution
is that it is quick to deploy - it often takes
less than 8 weeks to build a powerful digital
advisor - and is easily scalable. And that
means rapid and reliable results across the
organization. In today's fast-paced financial
services environment, that is critical.

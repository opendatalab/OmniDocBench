# . Interface Design Principles - I

· Anticipation-A WebApp should be designed so that it anticipates the
user's next move.

· Communication-The interface should communicate the status of any
activity initiated by the user

· Consistency-The use of navigation controls, menus, icons, and
aesthetics (e.g., color, shape, layout)

· Controlled autonomy-The interface should facilitate user movement
throughout the WebApp, but it should do so in a manner that enforces
navigation conventions that have been established for the application.

· Efficiency-The design of the WebApp and its interface should
optimize the user's work efficiency, not the efficiency of the Web
engineer who designs and builds it or the client-server environment
that executes it.

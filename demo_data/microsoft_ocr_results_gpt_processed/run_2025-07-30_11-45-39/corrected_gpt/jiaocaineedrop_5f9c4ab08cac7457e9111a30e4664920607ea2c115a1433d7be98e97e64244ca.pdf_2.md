# Environmental Research Group

In our advanced research
laboratories, WRI conducts
sophisticated and
comprehensive
environmental analyses and
research. This information is
the foundation that helps us
make decisions about living
responsibly within our
environment.

"The data we are able to
extract from thorough
testing procedures provides
vital input in decisions that
affect our choices and our
quality of life."

## An Interview with Dr. Rick Rediske, Program Manager

Why is it important for WRI to continue
to investigate the presence of chemical
contaminants in the environment?

The testing we do serves two purposes.
First, it helps define the nature and the
extent of a problem or a potential problem.
The best means of protecting our
water quality is by preventing problems
before they occur. That's why we need to
continually assess the condition of our
environment so we can detect changes
that might signal a potential problem.

Second, it provides important information
that will help decision-makers identify
what should happen next. Without adequate
data, those who are working
towards change will have a difficult time
developing viable solutions.

Has your lab developed any new testing
systems or procedures?

This past year we established a toxicology
laboratory designed to evaluate
the toxicity of sediments to aquatic

organisms. The laboratory is dedicated
exclusively to culturing specimens and
testing how toxins affect these organisms.

You completed an extensive investigation
of sediment contamination in the Tannery
Bay of White Lake in Muskegon County.
Can you give us a summary of the results
and tell us how this investigation will
help clean-up efforts?

The results of the project show that
there are adverse ecological effects associated
with the sediment contamination.
In addition, mixing and resuspension of
the sediments continues to move the contaminants
from Tannery Bay into other
parts of White Lake. The identification
of these issues has resulted in the
Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality raising the priority of sediment
remediation of Tannery Bay.

You recently developed an Agricultural
Water Quality Index (AWQI) to help evaluate
the relationship between farming
operations and water quality. Can you
explain the purpose of this index and why
it's important?

The index was designed specifically
for the agricultural community to assist
in evaluating potential water quality
impacts from farming operations. It
builds on established indices that examine
instream conditions and incorporates
a series of measurements that evaluate
land use impacts on water quality. It also
assists producers in evaluating the success

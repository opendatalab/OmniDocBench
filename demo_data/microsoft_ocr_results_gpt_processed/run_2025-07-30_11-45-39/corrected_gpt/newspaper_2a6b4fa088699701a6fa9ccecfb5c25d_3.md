listing is appropriate; we require
evidence that these stressors are
operative threats to the species and its
habitat, either singly or in combination,
to the point that the species meets the
definition of an endangered or a
threatened species under the Act.

In making our 12-month findings, we
considered and evaluated the best
available scientific and commercial
information regarding the past, present,
and future stressors and threats. We
reviewed the petition, information
available in our files, and other
available published and unpublished
information. This evaluation may
include information from recognized
experts; Federal, State, and tribal
governments; academic institutions;
foreign governments; private entities,
and other members of the public.


# Arizona Treefrog, Huachuca-Canelo Population (Hyla wrightorum)


## Previous Federal Actions

In our annual candidate notice of
review (CNOR) published on December
6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), we recognized
the Huachuca-Canelo population of the
Arizona treefrog as a candidate for
listing as a distinct population segment
(DPS). Subsequently, we published
similar findings in our CNORs on
December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176),
November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804).
November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222),
October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370).
November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994),
November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104),
December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and
December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584). In
2007, the Huachuca-Canelo population
of the Arizona treefrog was assigned a
listing priority number (LPN) of 3,
reflecting the taxonomic identity of the
listable entity as a subspecies/
population with threats that we
considered to be imminent and high in
magnitude. The LPN numbers range
from 1 to 11, with 1 being the highest
priority.


## Background

The Arizona treefrog (Hyla
wrightorum) is a small (4.6 centimeters
(cm) (1.8 inches (in)) green frog with a
dark eyestripe that extends past the
shoulder onto the side of the body, and
sometimes to the groin area. It occurs in
Madrean oak woodland and savannah,
pine-oak woodland, mixed conifer
forest, and Plains grasslands at
elevations of approximately 1,525 to
2,590 meters (m) (5,000 to 8,500 feet
(ft)), and requires ponds for successful
reproduction.

The Arizona treefrog is known to
occur within Arizona, New Mexico, and

Mexico. In Arizona and New Mexico,
the Arizona treefrog occurs along the
Mogollon Rim (central Arizona and
western New Mexico), in the Huachuca
Mountains and Canelo Hills area (a
disjunct mountain range on the
Arizona/Sonora, Mexico border), and
farther south in Mexico (in the Sierra
Madre Occidental and sky island
mountain ranges). We refer to these
three areas as the Mogollon Rim,
Huachuca-Canelo, and Mexico
populations.

Within the Huachuca-Canelo
population, historical information has
documented Arizona treefrogs from
three general localities at Rancho Los
Fresnos, Sonora, Mexico, and from 13 to
15 verified localities in the Huachuca
Mountains and Canelo Hills, Arizona.
The Huachuca-Canelo population of
Arizona treefrog has continued to
persist in Arizona sky island mountain
range and Plains grassland habitats, and
the treefrog has recently been found in
new locations within grasslands and
cienegas (a swamp or marsh, especially
one formed and fed by springs) in
Arizona. These new locations in varied
habitats indicate that the Arizona
treefrogs may be less selective in
choosing breeding habitat than
previously thought. In addition, the
species likely occurs in other wet
canyons with suitable breeding habitat
in the Huachuca Mountains, and
perhaps in cienegas in the vicinity of
Rancho Los Fresnos.

The Huachuca-Canelo DPS of the
Arizona treefrog was originally defined
based on the historical locations.
However, recently the Service has
received information on Arizona
treefrog locations nearby, but outside of,
the DPS area. This new information,
along with many new location
detections in the Huachuca Mountains
and Canelo Hills, indicates that the
Arizona treefrog is not only more
numerous, but is much more
widespread than we knew when the
Service made this Arizona treefrog a
candidate species as a DPS. There are
now approximately more than 30
known localities in Arizona in the
Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills,
and the Arizona treefrog also occurs in
areas outside of the DPS boundary, but
within the vicinity of the Huachuca
Mountains and Canelo Hills.


## Summary of Status Review

Based on new information and review
of previously referenced studies, we
find that the Huachuca-Canelo
population of the Arizona treefrog does
not meet the requirements of the
Service's Policy Regarding the
Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate

Population Segments (DPS Policy)
published in the Federal Register on
February 7, 1996 (61 FR 4722). The DPS
Policy sets forth three elements for the
Service to consider in determining
whether a vertebrate population is a
DPS that warrants listing: Whether the
population is discrete and whether the
population is significant. If the
population is determined to be both
discrete and significant, then the DPS
Policy requires the Service to evaluate
the conservation status of the
population to determine whether the
population falls within the Act's
definition of an "endangered species" or
of a "threatened species."

On the basis of the best available
scientific and commercial information,
and in accordance with our DPS Policy.
we conclude that the Huachuca-Canelo
population of the Arizona treefrog is
discrete but it is not significant (i.e., it
is not biologically or ecologically
important to the taxon as a whole.
Regarding discreteness, we have
reviewed the best available scientific
and commercial information and the
evidence relative to potential
differences in physical, behavioral,
morphological, and genetic attributes.
We conclude that the Huachuca-Canelo
population of the Arizona treefrog is
discrete based on its geographical
separation from the other two
populations on the Mogollon Rim and
in Mexico.

Regarding significance, we considered
the four classes of information listed in
the DPS Policy as possible
considerations in making a
determination, as well as all other
information that might be relevant to
making this determination for the
Huachuca-Canelo population. The
Huachuca-Canelo population of the
Arizona treefrog does not appear to
exhibit any direct or indirect habitat
adaptation or behavioral advantage that
would indicate that their persistence in
the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo
Hills area is biologically or ecologically
important to the taxon as a whole.
Moreover, we considered the other three
considerations that the DPS Policy sets
out for evaluating significance, and
none of them provides evidence that the
Huachuca-Canelo population is
significant to the Arizona treefrog as a
whole: (1) Loss of the Huachuca-Canelo
population would not result in a
significant gap in the range; (2) the
Huachuca-Canelo population does not
represent the only surviving natural
occurrence of the Arizona treefrog; and
(3) the Huachuca-Canelo population's
genetic characteristics do not differ
markedly from those of other Arizona
treefrog populations.

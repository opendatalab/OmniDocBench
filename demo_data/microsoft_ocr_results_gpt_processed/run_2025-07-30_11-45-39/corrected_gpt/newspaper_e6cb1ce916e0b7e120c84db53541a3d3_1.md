# Overview of This Information Collection

(1) Type of Information Collection
Request: Revision of a Currently
Approved Collection. This is a change
from the 60-day Federal Register Notice
published at 77 FR 38307. That notice
was an Extension, Without Change, of a
Currently Approved Collection. The
collection has been revised as a result of
changes required since the 60 day notice
was published that increased the time
required to complete this benefit
request.

(2) Title of the Form/Collection:
Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition.

(3) Agency form number, if any, and
the applicable component of the DHS
sponsoring the collection: I-730; USCIS.

(4) Affected public who will be asked
or required to respond, as well as a brief
abstract: Primary: Individuals or

households. Form I-730 will be used by
an asylee or refugee to file on behalf of
his or her spouse and/or children for
follow-to-join benefits provided that the
relationship to the refugee/asylee
existed prior to their admission to the
United States.

(5) An estimate of the total number of
respondents and the amount of time
estimated for an average respondent to
respond: 86,400 respondents with an
estimated burden per response of .667
hours [40 minutes]. This is a change
from the estimated burden per response
reported on the 60-day Federal Register
Notice published at 77 FR 38307. The
60-day notice estimated that the 86,400
respondents would require an estimated
burden per response of .583 hours (35
minutes).

(6) An estimate of the total public
burden (in hours) associated with the
collection: 57,600 Hours. This is a
change from the estimated total public
burden hours reported at 77 FR 38307,
which estimated the total burden
associated with this collection to be
50,371 hours.

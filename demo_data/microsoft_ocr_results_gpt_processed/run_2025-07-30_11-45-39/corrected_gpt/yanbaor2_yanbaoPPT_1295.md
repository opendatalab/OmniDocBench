# Section 1: What do they want?


## Key takeaway 3: Promoting iconic brand-product combinations is key

Young Chinese consumers told us
luxury helps them feel distinct from
the people with whom they share
their cities.

They see luxury as a form of social
capital that helps mark them apart, and
achieve personal and social goals.

That sentiment intensifies towards the
younger end of the spectrum, with
well over half the sample, and almost
70 percent of post-'90s consumers,
telling us they buy luxury to "feel
different rather than fit in with society."

Buying luxury is also a way to convey
and enjoy a shared social experience
and value system-a lifestyle and
community that lives and breathes
luxury, online and in the flesh.

Young Chinese consumers'
consumption of media, and the luxury
lifestyle it portrays, is consequently
heavily social and trend dependent-
a desire to be seen or snapped in the
latest styles drives consumption,
and with it a need for brands to
constantly update their styles or
leverage creative marketing to create
the illusion of newness.

More than three-quarters of young
Chinese consumers are thus most
interested in buying iconic styles that
are easily recognizable, with
the trend most prevalent among the
post-'85s/'70s consumers.

Indeed, the concept of a niche brand
has multiple meanings across luxury
segments, from one that exhibits
unique design to those that are niche
in the sense of being rarely seen on
the street, or simply not available in
mainland China.

In any case, China's luxury market
has yet to develop the widespread
sophistication necessary to sustain
demand for truly niche or boutique
brands, as has been the case in
the West.

Brand remains king when it comes to
informing taste across all our surveyed
generations, but is relatively less
important for younger consumers.
For example, brand was the top reason
for the last luxury purchase among
68 percent of the post-'90s consumers,
compared with 94 percent of the
post-'85s/'70s consumers (Exhibit 4).

Brand is important, but relatively less so among young consumers.

## Brand is still the most important factor but relatively less so vs the older generation

• Social influence accelerates
sophistication: consumers start
to appreciate more nuanced
elements such as design,
fabric, and manufacturing
process

· Commanding knowledge
beyond simply brand is another
form of social capital to be
demonstrated among peers

Participants ranked these 5 reasons as a contributing factor for their most recent purchase

Recently, the Service's Alabama
Ecological Services Field Office learned
that a specimen at the Museum of
Comparative Zoology in Boston,
Massachusetts, identified by T.A.
Conrad as A. melanoides is not the same
species that was described by Minton et
al. (2003). Therefore, we cannot with
any certainty determine the status of
either the entity that Conrad (1834) first
described as A. melanoides, or the
entity that Minton et al. (2003) re-
described as E. melanoides. Additional
taxonomic review, led by the
Smithsonian Institution, is underway as
of early 2016. The results of this review
will require additional efforts to define
Elimia spp. boundaries, status, and
distribution within the Black Warrior
River Basin.


# Finding

The Act only allows listing of
"species" as defined under Section
3[16]-that is, recognized species,
subspecies, or distinct population
segments of vertebrates. Based on our
review of the best available scientific
and commercial information, and in
light of the best available scientific
information regarding taxonomic
uncertainty described above, we
conclude that the black mudalia is not
currently a recognized "species." We
are therefore removing the black
mudalia from candidate status pending
further study.

As a result of the Service's 2011
multidistrict litigation settlement with
the Center for Biological Diversity and
WildEarth Guardians, the Service is
required to submit a proposed listing
rule or a not-warranted 12-month
finding to the Federal Register by
September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered
Species Act Section 4 Deadline
Litigation, No. 10-377 (EGS), MDL
Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)].
for all 251 species that were included as
candidate species in the Service's
November 10, 2010, CNOR. This
document satisfies the requirements of
that settlement agreement for the black
mudalia, and constitutes the Service's
12-month finding on the April 20, 2010,
petition to list the black mudalia as an
endangered or threatened species. A
detailed discussion of the basis for this
finding can be found in the black
mudalia's species-specific assessment
form and other supporting documents
(see ADDRESSES, above).


# Highlands Tiger Beetle (Cicindela highlandensis)


## Previous Federal Actions

The Highlands tiger beetle was first
recognized as a candidate species on

November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), when
we assigned the species an LPN of 2. In
the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR
54808), we changed the LPN for the
Highlands tiger beetle from 2 to 5,
because the immediacy of threats to the
species' scrub habitat had decreased
with the acquisition of scrub habitat by
the State of Florida and conservation
groups. On May 11, 2004, the Service
received a petition dated May 4, 2004,
from the Center for Biological Diversity
and others to list 225 species as
endangered or threatened, including the
Highlands tiger beetle. The species was
maintained as a candidate with an LPN
of 5 through the 2015 CNOR [see June
13, 2002 (67 FR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69
FR 24876); May 11, 2005 (70 FR 24870);
September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756),
December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034),
December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176),
November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804),
November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222),
October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370).
November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994),
November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104),
December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and
December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).


## Background

The Highlands tiger beetle is elongate
with an oval shape and bulging eyes,
and is one of the smallest (7.0-9.5 mm)
(0.28-0.37 in) tiger beetles in the United
States. As is typical of other tiger
beetles, adult Highlands tiger beetles are
active diurnal predators that use their
keen vision to detect movement of small
arthropods and run quickly to capture
prey with their well-developed
mandibles (jaws). Tiger beetle larvae
have an elongate white grub-like body
and a dark or metallic head with large
mandibles. Larvae are sedentary sit-and-
wait predators occurring in permanent
burrows flush with the ground surface.
When feeding, larvae position
themselves at the burrow mouth and
quickly strike at and seize small
arthropods that pass within a few
centimeters of the burrow mouth.
Larvae prey on small arthropods, similar
to adults.

The Highlands tiger beetle occurs
primarily in open sandy patches of
Florida scrub habitat on the Lake Wales
Ridge in Highlands and Polk Counties.
The Lake Wales Ridge is one of the
largest and oldest Florida scrub
ecosystems. The harsh environment on
the Lake Wales Ridge is characterized
by hot weather, nutrient-poor sandy
soils, and (historically) frequent
wildfires. The Highlands tiger beetle is
often associated with evergreen scrub
oaks, as well as high pineland with
deciduous turkey oak (Quercus laevis)
and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris).

High-quality habitat for the species is
primarily scrub or sandhill having
natural or management-created interior
patches with a high percent of open
sand (greater than 50 percent) that is
continuous or connected to adjacent
open patches by lightly disturbed trails
or paths. The known extant range of the
Highlands tiger beetle exists in the core
of the suitable (scrub) habitat in the
central and south-central portion of the
Lake Wales Ridge, approximately 90 km
(56 mi) in length and about 10 km (6 mi)
in width.


## Summary of Status Review

The following summary is based on
information contained in our files. The
Highlands tiger beetle is narrowly
distributed and restricted to areas of
bare sand within scrub and sandhill on
ancient sand dunes of the Lake Wales
Ridge in Polk and Highlands Counties,
Florida. Adult tiger beetles have been
found in 56 of the total 71 sites
surveyed at the core of the Lake Wales
Ridge. In 2004-2005 surveys, a total of
1,574 adults were found at four sites. A
total of 643 adults at 31 sites were found
in 1996, 928 adults at 31 sites in 1995,
and 742 adults at 21 sites in 1993. A
visual reference count of 2,231 adults
was found from 46 sites in 2014. This
increase in index counts over time can
be attributed to new survey sites and
finding a large number of beetles at
these sites. Estimates from the visual
reference (index) counts are used to
provide an estimate of the populations.
Results from a limited removal study
suggest that the actual population size at
some survey sites can be as much as two
to three times as high as the visual
reference. In addition, surveys for
Highlands tiger beetles were not
exhaustive, and there are additional
potential suitable habitats. An estimate
of beetle numbers likely present in these
additional potential habitats added to
the modified index count produces an
estimated minimum total abundance of
10,438 adults in at least 16 populations.
Based on these expanded surveys and
the findings of additional large beetle
populations at these sites, it is
determined that the Highlands tiger
beetle is more abundant than previously
documented, and its habitat is of much
better quality than previously
documented. Of the 15 sites with the
largest populations, 7 sites show an
increase in number of individuals. The
number of occupied sites identified as
high or good quality also increased from
13 in 2005, to 21 in 2014, and of the
currently known sites nearly half of
them (21 of 46) are of high or good
quality.

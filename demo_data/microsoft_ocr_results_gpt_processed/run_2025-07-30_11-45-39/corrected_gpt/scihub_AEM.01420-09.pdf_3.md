(data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mu-
tant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of
growth (μmax wt, 0.14; $\mathrm { \mu m a x } _ { \Delta c r t X } ; ,$ 0.22; $\mu \max _ { \Delta c r t E } ,$ 0.24; and
μmax ΔcrtY, 0.19; P = 0.000).

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing AcrtE,
△crtX, and △crtY in LB and M9 medium at 10℃ (for results in
M9, see Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, no significant dif-

ferences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for
△crtY, △crtE, and △crtX in both LB and M9 compared to those
of the wild type (in LB, $\mu \mathrm { m a x } _ { \mathrm { w t } } = 0 . 0 4 ,$ $\mu \max _ { \Delta c r t X } = 0 . 0 3 ,$ ,
$\mathrm { \mu m a x } _ { \Delta c r t E } = 0 . 0 3 ,$ and $\left. \mathrm { \mu m a x } _ { \Delta c r t Y } = 0 . 0 4 \right\}$ in M9, $\mu \max _ { \mathrm { w t } } =$
0.01, $\mathrm { \mu m a x } _ { \Delta c r t X } = 0 . 0 1$ , $\mathrm { \mu m a x } _ { \Delta c r t E } = 0 . 0 1$ , and $\mu \max _ { \Delta c r t Y } =$
0.01).

# Two Kentucky Cave Beetles (Louisville Cave Beetle (Pseudanophthalmus troglodytes) and Tatum Cave Beetle (Pseudanophthalmus parvus)


## Previous Federal Actions

The Louisville cave beetle and Tatum
Cave beetle were added to the Federal
list of candidate species in the
November 15, 1994, CNOR (59 FR
58982) as Category 2 species. Category
2 candidate species were identified as
those taxa for which the Service
possessed information indicating
proposing to list the taxa was possibly
appropriate, but for which conclusive
data on biological vulnerability and
threats sufficient to support a proposed
listing rule was lacking. The February
28, 1996, CNOR (61 FR 7596)
discontinued recognition of categories,
so both species were no longer
considered candidate species and were
therefore removed from the candidate
list.

In the October 30, 2001, CNOR, the
Service re-evaluated both cave beetle
species, and placed them back on the
candidate list through the Service's own
internal process with an LPN of 5 (66 FR
54808). The Service received a petition
from the Center for Biological Diversity
and others, dated May 11, 2004, to list
eight cave beetles, including the
Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave
beetle, as endangered or threatened
species. In the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70
FR 24870), the Service determined that
listing the Louisville cave beetle and
Tatum Cave beetle was warranted but
precluded by higher priority listing
decisions. Further, we have included
both species addressed in this finding in
every CNOR since 2001 (see October 30,
2001 (66 FR 54808); June 13, 2002 (67
FR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69 FR 24876);
May 11, 2005 (70 FR 24870); September
12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6,
2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008
(73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR
57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR
69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370),
November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994),
November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104),
December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and
December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).


## Background

These two species are small (about 4
mm (0.16 in) in length), predatory cave
beetles that occupy moist habitats
containing organic matter transported
from sources outside the cave
environment. Members of the
Pseudanophthalmus genus vary in
rarity from fairly widespread species
that are found in many caves to species
that are extremely rare and commonly
restricted to one or only a few cave

habitats. The Louisville cave beetle is
restricted to four caves in Jefferson
County, Kentucky, while the Tatum
Cave beetle is known from one cave
(Tatum Cave) in Marion County,
Kentucky.


## Summary of Status Review

When the Louisville cave beetle and
Tatum Cave beetle were identified as
candidates for protection under the Act
in the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR
54808), the Service considered both
species to be vulnerable to toxic
chemical spills, discharges of large
amounts of polluted water, closure or
alterations of cave entrances, and the
disruption of cave energy processes by
highway construction and industrial,
residential, and commercial
development. Our general perception
was that both species were vulnerable to
these habitat stressors, and we
suspected that these stressors were
significant and the species' overall
population trends were likely
decreasing. We also noted the lack of
State or Federal regulations to
ameliorate those threats. In the May 11,
2005, CNOR (70 FR 24870), we noted
both species' limited distribution and
how that would increase their
vulnerability to isolated events that
would have only a minimal effect on
more wide-ranging members of the
genus Pseudanophthalmus. Both
species were assigned an LPN of 5.


## Louisville Cave Beetle

Over the last 2 years, field surveys for
the Louisville cave beetle have provided
new information on the species
distribution and stressors. Based on this
new information, we have re-examined
the species' status and re-evaluated the
magnitude and imminence of its threats.
Lewis and Lewis confirmed the
continued presence of P. troglodytes in
Eleven Jones Cave (a period of 20 years)
and observed the species in three new
caves (Sauerkraut Cave, Cave Hill Cave,
and Cave Creek Cave), demonstrating
that the species is more abundant and
widespread than previously believed.
The species was difficult to find in each
of these caves (one to four individuals
observed), but this is not unusual for the
genus Pseudanophthalmus, which is
often difficult to find and is frequently
observed in low numbers. Population
estimates or discernable trends for these
populations have not been possible due
to the low number of individuals
observed and the difficulty in finding
specimens during repeat visits. We
acknowledge that caves within the
species' range likely continue to be
affected by many of the same stressors
identified by previous investigators:

reduced energy inputs, sedimentation,
pollution, and human visitation.
However, we have no evidence that
these stressors are operative threats that
are adversely affecting P. troglodytes at
a population level.


## Tatum Cave Beetle

With respect to the Tatum Cave
beetle, we have no evidence suggesting
that the species is still extant in Tatum
Cave. The species was relatively
abundant (20 individuals) in Tatum
Cave when first observed by C. H.
Krekeler in 1957, but the species
appeared to be less common in 1965,
when T. C. Barr observed only two
individuals. Since 1965, extensive
surveys of Tatum Cave have been
completed on eight separate occasions,
using search techniques similar to those
used by C. H. Krekeler and T. C. Barr
(i.e., methodical visual searches of all
available habitats). Three of these
survey efforts also involved the use of
baited pitfall traps (small cups buried in
the substrate and baited with limburger
cheese) placed in several locations
within Tatum Cave for a period of one
week. Despite all of these searches, no
Tatum Cave beetles have been observed
in Tatum Cave since the last observation
by Barr in 1965 (a period of 51 years).

The Tatum Cave beetle is small in size
and may be more difficult to locate than
some cave organisms; however, both
Krekeler and Barr were able to find the
species using methodical, visual
searches of suitable habitats in Tatum
Cave. Subsequent researchers have used
identical search methods on eight
separate occasions in the exact same
habitats within Tatum Cave, but no
Tatum Cave beetles have been observed.
Therefore, based on our review of the
best available scientific and commercial
information, the Service believes the
Tatum Cave beetle to be extinct. We
acknowledge that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to verify a species'
extinction. There is considerable
uncertainty about the actual status of
the species, and we acknowledge that,
as suggested by Lewis and Lewis, there
is some chance that the species remains
extant but occurs in low numbers and
is simply undetectable using traditional
search methods. However, considering
the best available scientific and
commercial information, we believe that
it is reasonable to conclude that the
species is extinct. The Service
encourages continued surveys for the
Tatum Cave beetle in Tatum Cave, as
time and funding allow. If the species is
subsequently found to be extant, we can
reevaluate its legal status under the Act
in the future.

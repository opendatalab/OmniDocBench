# 3.改进阅读方式

(1)预测:培养学生依据文章标题、插图以及相关的背景知识和社会生活经
验,对文章大致内容预测以及可能涉及到的词汇,然后阅读文章第一段,并对
预测进行验证,纠正,同时抓住主题句,关键词,从而更好地从整体上去
理解和把握文章中心。

(2)略读:指导学生快速浏览全文,领会文章大意,辩析文体,掌握篇章结构,
进而抓住文章中心。

(3)查读:在浏览全文基础上进行查读,以回答个别事实细节性的问题。有些
细节性的问题不能直接在短文中找到答案,要进行综合、归纳、转换才
能获得,也就是要在直接可获得的事实和细节的基础上经过综合、归纳,
转换,间接获得所需的事实和细节。它通常涉及数据、时间、人称、代词
的指代、动作的行为的关联,动作行为者与承受者、地点和空间、表态方
式、因果、条件、内涵与外延等。如:

One day Mrs Wilson went shopping with Tracy and Ben.
They went to the supermarket in the new shopping center.

1" Why do you buy things here?" Tracy wanted to know.
"Because they are cheaper here than at the corner store near
our home," Mrs Wilson said. "Help me check the prices, please."

The Wilsons were not rich and Mrs Wilson was alway careful
with her money. She looked carefully at the prices of things. She
bought lots of things in the supermarket. When they got home, the
children said, "We don't think you saved money by going to the
supermarket." "Of course I did," Mrs. Wilson said "Everything was cheaper.
"We know," the children said, "but we came home by taxi
because we had too much to carry. The taxi fare was more than
the money that you saved!"

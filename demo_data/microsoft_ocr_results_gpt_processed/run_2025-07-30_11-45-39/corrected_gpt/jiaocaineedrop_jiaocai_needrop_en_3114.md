十、文段表达(共15分)

75\. One possible version:

Nowadays, most middle school students have pocket money every month, and we did a survey in Class 1,
Grade 9.

As the result shows, among the thirty students taking part in the survey, most of them often buy snacks; about
a half spend their pocket money on books, and a few save some of it.

However, things for me are quite different. I usually spend most of the money buying good and educational
books which I think make me more knowledgeable. Only a small part is spent on snacks as most of the snacks are
in fact unhealthy for us. And I save the rest against a rainy day.

It is true that we have more and more pocket money now. Whether we can make good use of it really counts,
because it is partly influencing the way we are growing up.

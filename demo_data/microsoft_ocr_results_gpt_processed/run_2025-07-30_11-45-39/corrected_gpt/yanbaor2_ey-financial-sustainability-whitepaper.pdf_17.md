# Strategies to manage rising costs

In the face of declining revenues and rising input prices, many universities
are looking at ways to reduce operating costs. The two biggest cost
items for universities are payroll (and pension liability) and the cost of
maintaining and operating campus buildings. Struggling universities need
to address how to make cost savings in these two areas.

Getting visibility into key cost drivers is a challenge, leading many
institutions to engage in tactical cost-cutting exercises rather than working
to transform their cost structures. Some of these tactical initiatives include
cutting travel budgets, reducing energy bills and tightening spend on
consumables by revisiting procurement processes, switching suppliers or
renegotiating contracts.

However, this approach was aptly described by a few university leaders as
merely "trimming around the margins". To make a real impact on operating
costs, tougher decisions will need to be made, including investing in
technology, scaling back or cutting non-core projects, services or support.
A few of the universities interviewed had already undergone mergers to
achieve economies of scale and reduce duplication.

When considering the best cost reduction strategies, most universities
will need to improve their visibility of cost drivers, and in particular to
understand which costs are fixed, and which are variable. To streamline
cost structures, institutions require access to more granular and up-to-date
data on the true costs of running each course and maintaining each center.


## Reluctance to reduce staff headcount

Leaders are reluctant to include job reductions in cost-cutting measures,
but some have been forced to reduce headcount, tenured status and salary
costs to lower expenditure. Other approaches to reducing payroll include
cutting nonteaching staff through hiring freezes, replacing leavers with
more junior staff and merging roles.

However, these initiatives will only get institutions so far. Some universities
are thinking more strategically about their workforce strategies to prevent
over-hiring, using data to predict demand and hire accordingly.

While headcount reductions save money in the short term, leaders are
apprehensive about the longer-term costs associated with these measures.
Some noted the cultural cost of redundancies, with a loss of morale as
remaining staff fear for the safety of their jobs. One Vice Chancellor in
Australia said that reducing staff numbers inevitably removed staff who
had just been trained or upskilled, creating zero return on this investment.
Leaders are also concerned that reducing headcount could erode the
capacity of staff to engage in essential transformation projects.

Our biggest balance
sheet risk is using our
reserves for current
operational expenses...
and with our revenue
going down, not
generating enough
profit to add to
our reserves.

We invest a lot of
money and time in
developing people,
so to get rid of them
only to re-hire them
in 12 months doesn't
make sense.

207,638 tons of free tonnage raisins
acquired by handlers from producers
through the week ending June 19, 2004,
plus 129,345 tons of 2002-03 carryin NS
and Oleate inventory, equates to
398,009 tons of natural condition
raisins, or 373,117 tons of packed
raisins, that are available to handlers for
free use or primary markets. This is
almost 130 percent of the quantity of NS
raisins shipped during the 2002-03 crop
year (305,133 natural condition tons or
286,260 packed tons). (Oleates were
included in this computation because,
as previously stated, Oleates were
combined with the NS varietal type
beginning with the 2003-04 crop year.]

In addition to the 10 plus 10 offers,
$989.67(j) of the order provides
authority for sales of reserve raisins to
handlers under certain conditions such
as a national emergency, crop failure,
change in economic or marketing
conditions, inadequate carryover, or if
free tonnage shipments in the current
crop year exceed shipments of a
comparable period of the prior crop
year. Such reserve raisins may be sold
by handlers to any market. When
implemented, the additional offers of
reserve raisins make even more raisins
available to primary markets, which is
consistent with USDA's Guidelines.

The Committee plans to offer 5,714
tons of 2002-03 NS reserve raisins for
sale to handlers for free use pursuant to
$989.67(j). Free tonnage deliveries as of
June 19, 2004, were 207,638 tons, which
is 3,855 tons below the 211,493-ton
trade demand. Offering 3,855 tons of
reserve raisins for sale to handlers for
free use would allow the industry to
make available the full 211,493-ton
trade demand. Free tonnage shipments
from August 2003 through May 2004 are
1,859 tons greater than free tonnage
shipments during the same period last
year. Adding the 1,859 tons to the 3,855
tons equates to a total of 5,714 tons of
reserve being offered to handlers for free
use under $989.67(j) of the order.


# Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

Pursuant to requirements set forth in
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)
has considered the economic impact of
this action on small entities.
Accordingly, AMS has prepared this
final regulatory flexibility analysis.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit
regulatory actions to the scale of
business subject to such actions in order
that small businesses will not be unduly
or disproportionately burdened.
Marketing orders issued pursuant to the
Act, and rules issued thereunder, are
unique in that they are brought about
through group action of essentially

small entities acting on their own
behalf. Thus, both statutes have small
entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 20 handlers
of California raisins who are subject to
regulation under the order and
approximately 4,500 raisin producers in
the regulated area. Small agricultural
service firms are defined by the Small
Business Administration (13 CFR
121.201) as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000, and small
agricultural producers are defined as
those having annual receipts of less than
$750,000. Thirteen of the 20 handlers
subject to regulation have annual sales
estimated to be at least $5,000,000, and
the remaining 7 handlers have sales less
than $5,000,000. No more than 7
handlers, and a majority of producers, of
California raisins may be classified as
small entities.

Since 1949, the California raisin
industry has operated under a Federal
marketing order. The order contains
authority to, among other things, limit
the portion of a given year's crop that
can be marketed freely in any outlet by
raisin handlers. This volume control
mechanism is used to stabilize supplies
and prices and strengthen market
conditions.

Pursuant to $989.54(d) of the order,
this rule continues in effect final
volume regulation percentages for 2003-
04 crop NS raisins. The volume
regulation percentages are 70 percent
free and 30 percent reserve. Free
tonnage raisins may be sold by handlers
to any market. Reserve raisins must be
held in a pool for the account of the
Committee and are disposed of through
certain programs authorized under the
order.

Volume regulation is warranted this
season for NS raisins because
acquisitions of 296,625 tons through the
week ending June 19, 2004, combined
with the carryin inventory of 129,345
tons, results in a total available supply
of 425,970 tons, which is about 200
percent higher than the 211,493-ton
trade demand. (Oleate inventory was
included in this computation because,
as previously stated, Oleates were
combined with the NS varietal type
beginning with the 2003-04 crop year.]

The current volume regulation
procedures have helped the industry
address its marketing problems by
keeping supplies in balance with
domestic and export market needs, and
strengthening market conditions. The
current volume regulation procedures
fully supply the domestic and export
markets, provide for market expansion,
and help reduce the burden of
oversupplies in the domestic market.

Raisin grapes are a perennial crop, so
production in any year is dependent
upon plantings made in earlier years.
The sun-drying method of producing
raisins involves considerable risk
because of variable weather patterns.

Even though the product and the
industry are viewed as mature, the
industry has experienced considerable
change over the last several decades.
Before the 1975-76 crop year, more than
50 percent of the raisins were packed
and sold directly to consumers. Now,
over 60 percent of raisins are sold in
bulk. This means that raisins are now
sold to consumers mostly as an
ingredient in another product such as
cereal and baked goods. In addition, for
a few years in the early 1970's, over 50
percent of the raisin grapes were sold to
the wine market for crushing. Since
then, the percent of raisin-variety grapes
sold to the wine industry has decreased.

California's grapes are classified into
three groups-table grapes, wine grapes,
and raisin-variety grapes. Raisin-variety
grapes are the most versatile of the three
types. They can be marketed as fresh
grapes, crushed for juice in the
production of wine or juice concentrate,
or dried into raisins. Annual
fluctuations in the fresh grape, wine,
and concentrate markets, as well as
weather-related factors, cause
fluctuations in raisin supply. This type
of situation introduces a certain amount
of variability into the raisin market.
Although the size of the crop for raisin-
variety grapes may be known, the
amount dried for raisins depends on the
demand for crushing. This makes the
marketing of raisins a more difficult
task. These supply fluctuations can
result in producer price instability and
disorderly market conditions.

Volume regulation is helpful to the
raisin industry because it lessens the
impact of such fluctuations and
contributes to orderly marketing. For
example, producer prices for NS raisins
remained fairly steady from the 1993-94
through the 1997-98 seasons, although
production varied. As shown in the
table below, during those years,
production varied from a low of 272,063
tons in 1996-97 to a high of 387,007
tons in 1993-94, or about 42 percent.
According to Committee data, the total
producer return per ton during those
years, which includes proceeds from
both free tonnage plus reserve pool
raisins, has varied from a low of $904.60
in 1993-94 to a high of $1,049 in 1996-
97, or 16 percent. Total producer prices
for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons
increased significantly due to back-to-
back short crops during those years.
Producer prices dropped dramatically
for the last three seasons due to record-

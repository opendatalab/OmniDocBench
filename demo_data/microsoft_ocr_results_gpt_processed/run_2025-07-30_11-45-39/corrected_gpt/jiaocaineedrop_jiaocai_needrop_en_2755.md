# 27. In the experiment of observing the boiling of water, Xiaoming's experimental record table is as follows:

(1) In the beaker, cover it with a hard paper sheet to observe that when the water boils, a large number of bubbles form in the water and rise to the surface, breaking open, and the water vapor inside disperses into the air. From the experiment, it can be concluded that boiling is a violent phenomenon that occurs simultaneously from the liquid. The liquid absorbs heat during the boiling process, but the temperature remains constant.

| 温度(℃) | 90℃ | 92℃ | 94℃ | 96℃ | 98℃ | 99℃ | 99℃ | 96℃ | 99℃ |

(3) From the table, it can be seen that the water starts to boil after heating for ___ minutes, and the boiling point of water is __℃. The atmospheric pressure above the water is (fill in "greater than" or "less than") one atmosphere.

(4) Xiaoli observed two situations of bubbles rising in the water before and during boiling, as shown in Figures (a) and (b). Figure ____ shows the situation before boiling, and Figure ____ shows the situation during boiling.

(a)

(b)

28. As shown in Figure B, it is an experimental device to explore the temperature change of a certain liquid substance during the solidification process. Based on the experimental data, the temperature change of the liquid substance during the solidification process is depicted in Figure A. From the image, it can be seen that the substance is (fill in "crystal" or "amorphous"), and the time taken for the liquid substance to completely solidify from the beginning is ___ minutes. The reading of the thermometer at the end of 8 minutes is shown in Figure B, and the reading of the thermometer is ___℃.

29. In the cold winter, the glass windows of residential buildings will "sweat" or form "ice flowers." The following statements are incorrect ()

A. The "sweat" on the glass window is formed by the liquefaction of water vapor.

B. The "ice flowers" on the glass window are formed by the sublimation of water vapor.

C. "Ice flowers" form on the inner surface of the glass window.

D. "Sweat" forms on the outer surface of the glass window.

30. A factory needs to manufacture a special-purpose steel-aluminum can, with a 0.25mm thick aluminum film pressed onto the inner surface of the steel can. This posed a challenge for welding and forging experts. After joint efforts by technical personnel, the problem was solved: they first tightly attached the aluminum film to the inner surface of the steel can, then filled the steel can with water, inserted a freezing tube to freeze the water, and then the aluminum film and the steel can were pressed together. The reason is ()

A. The water between the aluminum film and the steel can froze them together.

B. The ice between the aluminum film and the steel can glued them together.

C. The huge pressure generated by the expansion of water during freezing pressed them together.

D. The heat released during the freezing of water welded them together.

performed the total energy of these phases as a function of
volume and their energy-volume relations were fit to the third-
order Birch Murnaghan equation of states. The energy-
volume curve of the structures is presented in Fig. 2 and as
shown ZB structure has the lowest energy. On the other hand,
to determine the most stable structure at finite pressure and
temperature, the free energy $\mathrm { G } = \mathrm { E } _ { \mathrm { t o t } } + \mathrm { P V - T S }$ should be used.
Our density functional calculations are basically completed at
zero Kelvin temperature and entropic contributions can be
ignored. Therefore, the enthalpy values, $\mathrm { H } = \mathrm { E } + \mathrm { p V } ,$ including
the pressure-volume effects are determined. This behavior is
compatible with a phase transition between these structures,
which is also clearly reflected in the enthalpy calculation.

Simple comparison of the static lattice enthalpies of ZB
state, I4m2 (binary β-tin) and the Imm2 state determines the
pressure of the transition between them. The crossing of
three enthalpy curves indicates a pressure-induced phase
transition between these phases. The computed enthalpy
curves of the ZB, I4m2 and Imm2 phases are plotted as a
function of pressure in Fig. 3. As can be seen from the
figure, the enthalpy curves of the I4m2 phase and Imm2
phase have the same enthalpy and intersect with that of ZB
phase at 4.8 GPa, indicating a first order phase transition
between these phases. On the other hand, from the energy-
volume data, we also calculate the bulk modulus of these
phases. For the zinc-blende state, our bulk modulus is

53.2 GPa, which is relatively close to the theoretical values
46 GPa and 48.98 GPa [18, 19]. The bulk modulus can vary
in a wide range according to the methodology of the study.
The bulk modulus of the I4m2 (binary β-tin) phase is
calculated to be 70.7 GPa and the bulk modulus of the
Imm2 phase is calculated to be 75.7 GPa. In general, our
results agree with the experimental and theoretical results.


# Parinello Rahman simulation

The pressure-volume relation of CdTe obtained through the
constant pressure simulation can be seen in Fig. 4. As can be
seen from the figure, the volume monotonically decreases
with increasing pressure to 15 GPa. When the pressure is
increased from 15 to 20 GPa the structural phase transition
begins and volume shows a noticeable decrease, which is
typical for a first order phase transition. The structural analysis
brings out that zinc-blende CdTe converts into a I4m2 (binary
β-tin) structure. This tendency is indeed anticipated when
some conditions in simulations are considered, namely, the
use of ideal structure, the size of the simulated structure etc.
Consequently, simulated systems have to cross a significant
energy barrier to transform from one phase to another.

In this study, we are particularly interested in understand-
ing the transformation mechanism to control structural
phase transition. Therefore, as a next step, we studied the
atomic movement during the phase transformation by

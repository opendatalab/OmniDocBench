If you find the weather
intriguing, then you
may want to
investigate a career in
meteorology.
Meteorologists spend
their time studying
weather and
forecasting changes in

analyze charts, weather
maps, and other data to make
predictions about future weather patterns.
Meteorologists also research different types
of weather, such as tornadoes and
hurricanes, and may even teach at
universities.

As a meteorologist, you may choose to
specialize in one of several areas such as
climatology, operational meteorology, or
industrial meteorology. As a meteorologist,
you might even be seen on television
forecasting the weather for your area!

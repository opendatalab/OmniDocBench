Instead, the consumer protection laws and
other laws of her state regulate her business.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the
agency of the U.S. government that promotes
free and fair trade competition. The Bureau of
Consumer Protection safeguards consumers
against unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent prac-
tices. Both organizations investigate violations
of federal consumer protection law.

Unfair and Deceptive Practices

An unfair and deceptive practice is an
act that misleads consumers. Most states have
enacted either the Uniform Deceptive Trade
Practices Act or their own similar laws. In Texas, for example, the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) was enacted to protect consumers
against false, misleading, and deceptive business and insurance prac-
tices, and unconscionable actions and breach of warranty. Although state
laws differ, all are similar to federal law. If you believe you are the vic-
tim of an unfair or deceptive practice, you might start by contacting the
business with your complaint. Figure 15.1 provides an example of a
complaint letter that you might send.

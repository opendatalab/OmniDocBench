## Team One: Julian and Anne

Julian, from Team One, is a white, senior English/Comparative Literature major who had worked in the EWC for two years,
including a quarter as an in-class tutor with me. Julian commented minimally on papers and met one-to-one with students at the
EWC. He also attended two in-class peer reviews. He has the most experience tutoring one-to-one and in the classroom of all the
tutors. Having worked with Julian very closely for two years prior to this study, I found him outspoken and highly intelligent.

Anne is a white, third year TA in English Language and Rhetoric. She had one year of teaching experience with first-years prior to
this pairing. She had extensive training and experience, about five years, teaching one-to-one for the EWC and CLUE (CLUE, or
the Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment, is another campus student-support service that houses an evening writing
center.) She had also presented at several national and regional writing center and Composition and Rhetoric conferences.

## Team Two: Megan and Laura

Team Two includes Megan and Laura. Megan attended class every day and worked one-to-one with students at the EWC. Megan is
a white, senior Communications/English major who had been tutoring at the EWC for two years. She was planning to pursue K-12
teaching. Like all the EWC tutors (except Sam) she took a five-credit course in writing center theory and practice. Megan
considered herself not the strongest writer. During her interview she described how struggling with an English class, from which
she eventually earned a 4.0, persuaded her to apply to the EWC. Having worked with her an entire summer, to me Megan always
seemed very nice (often "bubbly") and approachable.

Laura is a second year TA and Chinese International student, focusing on postcolonial studies and Asian-American literature. She
had one year of teaching experience with first-years prior to this pairing.

## Team Three: Madeleine and Sydney

Due to her schedule, Madeleine, from Team Three, attended class every other day and worked one-to-one with students at the IC.
Madeleine is an African-American sophomore English (creative writing) major who had worked for the IC only one quarter prior
to this pairing. She enjoys performing spoken-word poetry. She did not receive any formal training in one-to-one teaching prior to
this pairing. She attended a college prep high school and participated in running start. Prior to this study, I was not familiar with the
personality or tutoring patterns of Madeleine.

Sydney, a woman of color (African-American) herself, is a second year TA studying nineteenth- and twentieth-century African-
American literature. She had about five years of teaching and tutoring experience with high school students and one year of
teaching with first-years prior to this pairing. On her wish-list, Sydney had written me a note asking, if at all possible, for a tutor of
color. Serendipity worked in her favor in the form of Madeleine, whom I would later learn was the only IC tutor willing to
participate in this study.

It is clear that the Asian fintech scene is still maturing overall and still is not quite as developed as other regions, as
consolidation is still kicking in. The fact that giant corporations dominate many aspects of fintech already has also
contributed to lower M&A volume. However, the fact M&A can rebound speaks to increasing consolidation amid at
least the smaller end of players, even if financial giants are holding mammoth sums of growth-stage or late-stage
capital.

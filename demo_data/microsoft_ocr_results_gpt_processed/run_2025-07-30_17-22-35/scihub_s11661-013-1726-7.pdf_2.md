contents of Mn and Si, which is consistent with the
literature.[16,30] After being SHTed for 8 hours, almost
the entire amount of Al2Cu is dissolved into the Al
matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to
note that the Chinese script $\alpha$ -Fe phase becomes
unstable and is transformed into a small amount of
short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmenta-
tion of the $\alpha$ -Fe.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich interme-
tallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours)
conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in
Table II. It can be found that higher Al contents are
detected in the $\alpha$ -Fe and STed $\beta$ -Fe after SHT than the
corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from
the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contri-
bution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small
sizes of the fragmented $\alpha$ -Fe and STed $\beta$ -Fe particles
after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition, it can
be found that the iron content in α-Fe is reduced after

SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the
EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of
0.452, lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical
for an accurate solution,[31] indicate that this phase is
still the $\alpha$ -Fe (body-centered cubic with a, b, and $c$ as
1.265 nm[11]). Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic
phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical
composition to the $\beta$ -Fe obtained in the as-cast condi-
tion (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-trans-
formed $\beta$ -Fe (STed $\beta \cdot$ Fe) to distinguish it from the $\beta$ -Fe
directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidifica-
tion. The formation of the STed $\beta$ -Fe is further
confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by
EBSD (Figure 2(d)), The STed $\beta \cdot$ -Fe is most likely to
have the same crystal structure as the solidified $\beta$ -Fe
(tetragonal with a and b of 0.634 nm and c of
1.488 nm[11]) due to their similar diffraction patterns.
However, the STed $\beta$ Fe has lower Cu content than the
$\beta$ -Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the Cu by Al

# Workshop Objectives

The Protected Species Safe Handling,
Release, and Identification Workshops
are designed to teach longline and
gillnet fishermen the required
techniques for the safe handling and
release of entangled and/or hooked
protected species, such as sea turtles,
marine mammals, and smalltooth
sawfish. In an effort to improve
reporting, the proper identification of
protected species will also be taught at
these workshops. Additionally,
individuals attending these workshops
will gain a better understanding of the
requirements for participating in these
fisheries. The overall goal of these
workshops is to provide participants
with the skills needed to reduce the
mortality of protected species, which
may prevent additional regulations on
these fisheries in the future.

for the Bureau's consumer complaint

routing of complaints to the companies
that are the subjects of the complaints,
the Bureau is developing a form which
will allow companies to proactively
participate in the Bureau's Company
Portal (Company Portal), a secure, Web-

based interface between the Bureau's
Office of Consumer Response
[Consumer Response] and companies.
The Company Portal allows companies
to view and respond to complaints
submitted through the Bureau's
complaint handling system. Many
companies have sought to register with
the Company Portal before consumer
complaints have been submitted to the
Bureau about their companies to ensure
early notice of potential complaints and
allow companies' users to acclimate to
the software and security protocols
needed to access the Company Portal.
The Bureau's proposed form, the
Company Portal Boarding Form
{Boarding Form}, will serve to
streamline information collection from
these companies, result in a greatly
enhanced and efficient experience from
both the consumers and companies'
perspectives.

burden of the collection of information

request for Office of Management and

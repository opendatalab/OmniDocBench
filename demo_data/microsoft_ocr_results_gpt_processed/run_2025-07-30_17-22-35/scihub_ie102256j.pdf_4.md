increase as the value of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 }$ decreases. However, the offset does
not exceed 0.1 mol % even for the case of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 } = 1 . 5 0$ .

The results of this ternary system differ significantly from
those of the quaternary systems in terms of the actions of
temperature controllers. The studies on quaternary systems
concluded that the two temperature controllers had to have
the same action.6 However, dynamically stable results are ob-
tained for this ternary system with temperature controllers
having opposite actions. Details of the physical explanation of
this situation are given in a recent paper.

3.2. Ternary System with Inert Component. The flowsheet
of ternary system with inert is given in Figure 9. This system
involves four components. However, one of them is an inert
component $I$ in terms of the reaction. Since its volatility is
assumed the same as that of the light reactant $A$ , it is fed from the
fresh feed stream $F _ { A 0 }$ as a mixture with $A .$ The other fresh feed
stream $F _ { B O }$ contains pure reactant $B$ . While the heavy product $\mathrm { C }$
leaves the column from the bottom, the low-boiling inert I is
removed from the distillate without taking part in the reaction.
Thus, the column has three zones: a stripping section, a reactive
zone, and a rectifying section. It is assumed that the light and
heavy fresh feed streams are fed from the bottom and top trays of
the reactive zone, respectively.

The main design objective is to obtain the purity of the
bottoms product at 98 mol % $C .$ On the other hand, the amount
of reactants escaping from the distillate stream should also be
considered. This is especially important for the light reactant
$A$ , which has an identical volatility with the inert component $I .$

Thus, a constraint of 3 mol % is defined for the maximum amount
of reactants leaving the column from the top. The liquid holdups
in the reactive trays are selected as 2000 mols to have reasonable
liquid height. The composition of $F _ { A O }$ is 50 mol % $A$ and 50 mol
% I. Kinetic parameters of the ternary system are given in Table 5.
The basic design procedure is based on the existing paper in the
literature.21

The optimization problem for the ternary system with inert
includes five design variables. These are (1) the number of
stripping trays $N _ { S } , \left( 2 \right)$ the number of reactive trays $N _ { R X } ,$ and (3)
the number of rectifying trays $N _ { \mathcal{B} } ,$ (4) the column pressure $P _ { 1 } ,$ and
(5) the reflux $R$ . The objective function is TAC, and the same
basis of economics is used as that has been used for the ternary
system without inert component.

Table 6 gives the optimum design parameters and economics
for the relative volatility cases considered. For the base case of
$\alpha _ { 3 9 0 } = 2 . 0 0$ , the optimum operating pressure of the column is 9
bar. The bottoms purity of 98 mol % C is achieved with a column
having 7 stripping, 12 reactive, and 7 rectifying trays. The column
diameter is 1.00 m with a vapor boilup of 55.06 mol/s. The total
capital investment for the column, reboiler, and condenser is
$5 5 3 2 . 4 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 }$ , while the cost of energy is $\mathrm { S 2 3 7 . 3 3 } \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { y r } .$
Assuming a payback period of 3 years, the TAC is $S 4 1 4 . 8 0 \times$
$1 0 ^ { 3 } / \mathrm { y r }$ . There is a slight decrease in the operating pressure with
the decrease of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 } ,$ but the change is not dramatic. This
decrease is reasonable because lower pressure helps the VLE
by reducing temperatures and increasing relative volatilities.
There is an increase in the optimum number of total trays with
the decrease of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 } .$ Decrease of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 }$ from 2.00 to 1.75 results in
a higher change in the number of separation trays. On the other
hand, the increase in the number of reactive trays is more
remarkable for the case of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 } = 1 . 5 0 .$ The other design variable
reflux $R$ and the vapor boilup $V _ { S }$ increase dramatically as $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 }$
declines. Thus, the capital and energy costs get significantly
higher as the value of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 }$ decreases.

Figure 10 shows the temperature profiles of three relative
volatility cases. There is a sharp temperature profile for the case of
$\alpha _ { 3 9 0 } = 2 . 0 0$ . This is especially true for the stripping section. The
decrease of the value of $\alpha _ { 3 9 0 }$ moderates the sharpness of the
temperature profile. The size of the hump in the reactive zone also

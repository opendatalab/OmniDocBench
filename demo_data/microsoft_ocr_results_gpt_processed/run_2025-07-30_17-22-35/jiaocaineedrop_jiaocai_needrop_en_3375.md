## Preparing Cities for Robot Cars

The possibility of self-driving robot cars has often seemed like a futurist's dream, years away from
materializing in the real world. Well, the future is apparently now. The California Department of Motor Vehicles
began giving permits in April for companies to test truly self-driving cars on public roads. The state also cleared
the way for companies to sell or rent out self-driving cars, and for companies to operate driverless taxi services.
California, it should be noted, isn't leading the way here. Companies have been testing their vehicles in cities
across the country. It's hard to predict when driverless cars will be everywhere on our roads. But however long
it takes, the technology has the potential to change our transportation systems and our cities, for better or for
worse, depending on how the transformation is regulated.

While much of the debate so far has been focused on the safety of driverless cars (and rightfully so),
policymakers also should be talking about how self-driving vehicles can help reduce traffic jams, cut emissions(排
放)and offer more convenient, affordable mobility options. The arrival of driverless vehicles is a chance to make
sure that those vehicles are environmentally friendly and more shared.

Do we want to copy-or even worsen-the traffic of today with driverless cars? Imagine a future where
most adults own individual self-driving vehicles. They tolerate long, slow journeys to and from work on packed
highways because they can work, entertain themselves or sleep on the ride, which encourages urban spread.
They take their driverless car to an appointment and set the empty vehicle to circle the building to avoid
paying for parking. Instead of walking a few blocks to pick up a child or the dry cleaning, they send the self-
driving minibus. The convenience even leads fewer people to take public transport-an unwelcome side effect
researchers have already found in ride-hailing(叫车)services.

A study from the University of California at Davis suggested that replacing petrol-powered private cars
worldwide with electric, self-driving and shared systems could reduce carbon emissions from transportation
80% and cut the cost of transportation infrastructure(基础设施)and operations 40% by 2050. Fewer emissions
and cheaper travel sound pretty appealing. The first commercially available driverless cars will almost certainly be
fielded by ride-hailing services, considering the cost of self-driving technology as well as liability and maintenance
issues(责任与维护问题).But driverless car ownership could increase as the prices drop and more people become
comfortable with the technology.

Policymakers should start thinking now about how to make sure the appearance of driverless vehicles
doesn't extend the worst aspects of the car-controlled transportation system we have today. The coming

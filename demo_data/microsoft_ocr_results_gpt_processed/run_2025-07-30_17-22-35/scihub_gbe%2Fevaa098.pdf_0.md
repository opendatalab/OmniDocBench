## Abstract

Although the human Y chromosome has effectively shown utility in uncovering facets of human evolution and population histories,
the ascertainment bias present in early Y-chromosome variant data sets limited the accuracy of diversity and TMRCA estimates
obtained from them. The advent of next-generation sequencing, however, has removed this bias and allowed for the discovery of
thousands of new variants for use in improving the Y-chromosome phylogeny and computing estimates that are more accurate.
Here, we describe the high-coverage sequencing of the whole Y chromosome in a data set of 19 male Khoe-San individuals in
comparison with existing whole Y-chromosome sequence data. Due to the increased resolution, we potentially resolve the source of
haplogroup B-P70 in the Khoe-San, and reconcile recently published haplogroup A-M51 data with the most recent version of the
ISOGG Y-chromosome phylogeny. Our results also improve the positioning of tentatively placed new branches of the ISOGG Y-
chromosome phylogeny. The distribution of major Y-chromosome haplogroups in the Khoe-San and other African groups coincide
with the emerging picture of African demographic history; with E-M2 linked to the agriculturalist Bantu expansion, E-M35 linked to
pastoralist eastern African migrations, B-M112 linked to earlier east-south gene flow, A-M14 linked to shared ancestry with central
African rainforest hunter-gatherers, and A-M51 potentially unique to the Khoe-San.

Key words: Y chromosome, next-generation sequencing, haplogroups, Khoe-San, southern Africa.

## Introduction

The male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY)
has long been regarded as an effective tool in the study
of human evolutionary history (Underhill and Kivisild
2007). It has proved useful mainly due to a lack of re-
combination along its length, making it the longest

haplotypic block in the human genome (Scozzari et al.
2012); and its paternal mode of inheritance. The trans-
mission of an intact haplotype from father to son, chang-
ing only through mutation, preserves a simpler record of
its history and allows us to study the male contribution to
the shaping of humanity.

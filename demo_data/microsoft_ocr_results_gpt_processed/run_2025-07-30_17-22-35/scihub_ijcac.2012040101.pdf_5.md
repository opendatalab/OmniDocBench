Table 1. Descriptive statistics and Cronbach's Reliability

| Construct | Mean | SD | Cronbach's α |
| - | - | - | - |
| PU | 3.74 | 0.88 | 0.89 |
| PEU | 3.93 | 1.03 | 0.92 |
| AT | 3.86 | 0.87 | 0.86 |
| BI | 3.9 | 0.96 | 0.74 |


These responses came from IT organizations in
public sectors, such as IT centers in universities,
ministries and institutions as well as from major
IT companies in the Kingdom. Respondents
also were kindly asked to resend the survey
hyperlink to their colleagues working in the IT
sector. Further details about the study sample
are presented in the sample section.


# RESULTS


## Validation Tests

Before commencing with the data analysis
process, several validation tests were car-
ried out in order to ensure the reliability and
discriminant validity of the instruments. For
instance, Cronbach alpha test was performed
on the items of each construct to ensure the
validity of the questionnaire and its internal
consistency. The reliability of items in each
construct ranged from 0.74 for behavioral in-
tention to 0.92 for perceived ease of use (Table
1), which exceeded the standard suggested by
Nunnally and Bernstein (1994). Therefore, the
internal consistency of the questionnaire was
within an acceptable range.

Furthermore, factor analysis was carried
out in order to test the convergent and dis-
criminant validity of the instrument (question-
naire). A total of 28 items were analyzed at the
level of four factors (i.e., perceived usefulness,
perceived ease of use, attitude and behavioral
intention). Table 2 shows the correlation matrix
for the factor analysis using principal component
analysis as an extraction method and Varimax
rotation. It can clearly be noticed that each item
scored higher (i.e., higher than 0.50) in its

construct than any other construct. According
to Fornell and Larcker (1981), this result rep-
resents a satisfactory level of discriminate
validity and convergence.


## Sample

As mentioned previously, the questionnaire
was distributed by e-mail to people who work
in information technology organizations in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A total of 171
completed surveys were received and used for
analysis. Seventy-three percent of respondents
were male and the majority of the respondents
were aged between 20 and 35 years old. Table
3 shows a descriptive analysis of sample char-
acteristics.


## Hypotheses Testing

The first five hypotheses (i.e., hypothesis 1-5)
tested the relationships amongst the regular
TAM constructs (PU, PEU, AT and BI) while
the rest of the hypotheses (i.e., hypothesis 6-10)
tested the effect of the external variables (age,
gender, job domain, education and nationality)
on attitudes towards cloud computing in Saudi
organizations. In order to test these hypotheses,
linear regression was applied on the obtained
data. The results are presented in Table 4. Hy-
potheses 1 and 2 tested the effects of PU and
PEU on the AT of cloud computing in Saudi or-
ganizations respectively. Moreover, hypotheses
6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 tested the effect of gender, age,
education, job domain and nationality on the
AT of cloud computing in Saudi organizations,
respectively. Entering all variables in one block,
the results presented a significant percentage
of variance 62% (R2=0.65, F (7,163)=37.92,

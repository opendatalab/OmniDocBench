# 2.3.4. Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM)

ESEM (Quanta FEG 250, FEI, Hillsboro OR, USA) was used to
observe the morphology and microstructure of the NT@RCBS. Dif-
ferent from traditional scanning electron microscopy, ESEM
requires no pre-treatment such as drying, conduction, or dehydra-
tion. Hence, the samples were directly placed under the lens to
obtain the micrographs. The micro-spectroscopy elements were
analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford
Instruments 7274).


# 2.3.5. Mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP)

An automatic mercury intrusion analyzer (AutoPore IV9500)
produced by McMuretick Instrument Company of the United States
was used for pore structure determination. All data acquisition and
processing were controlled and completed by the computer. The
maximum pressure of the instrument is 33,000 Psia, and the pore
size can be measured in the range of 6-360,000 nm. Samples were
in advance oven dried at 105 ℃, for 12 h and then placed into the
machine for analysis.


## 2.3.6. Durability test (anti-abrasion performance)

The durable performance of photocatalytic mortar is embodied
by the anti-abrasion performance. To simulate natural abrasion
triggered by wind, touching, and stepping [18], one abrasive paper
with grade of Cw 220-2c was utilized to abrade the sample surface
by 500 times back and forth. To ensure the same abrasion condi-
tion (friction force) for all samples, the gravity that was perpendic-
ular to the friction and the friction coefficient that was determined
by friction surfaces were maintained exactly the same. The former
was realized by attaching the abrasive paper to the surface of a
brick with constant weight; whilst the latter was achieved by
updating abrasive papers for each testing sample. Each result
was the average of three paralleled tests.


# 3. Results and discussion


## 3.1. Characterization of CPs

Fig. 7(the upper subgraph) presents the micrograph of NT@RG.
EDS performed at point 44 reveals that the material loaded onto
the surface of RG is NT. In comparison, point 46 held almost no
Ti. That is, the soaking method ensures only some parts of the sur-
face of RG are covered by NT while some other parts are not. It is
crucial because photorefraction is provided by transparent areas
that should not be covered by NT. On the contrary, Fig. 7(the lower
subgraph) exhibits the micrograph of NT@RCBS and confirms that
NT is loaded onto part of the surface and filled into some pores of
RCBS during the preparation of the CPs. This statement contains
two sections. First, some NT is loaded onto part of the surface of
RCBS. It is proved by the ESEM pictures along with the EDS (see
Fig. 7). Since the spectrum at both points 54 and 55 display high
proportions of Ti that is not held by RCBS itself (see Table 1). In par-
ticular, during the soaking, the RCBS was fully immersed into the
NT solution. That is to say, NT particles surrounded the RCBS and
had the equal chance to load onto any part of RCBS because no par-
ticular part of RCBS was proved to have the capacity of selective
adsorption. Furthermore, the ESEM and EDS were pictured ran-
domly. To some degree, they at least prove that the majority of
RCBS surface is covered by NT. Second, RCBS has a porous structure
and extremely rough surface. Some NT particles are deposited and
accumulated inside the pores as well as on the surface. This is
proved by the porosity and pore size distribution analysis, with
results in Fig. 8b. The porosities of RCBS and NT@RCBS are 29
and 26.5%, respectively. The reduced porosity of NT@RCBS relative
to RCBS is due to the filling of NT after the soaking. The absolute
reduction is only 2.5% which echoes the limited NT loading amount
measured by the analytical balance below. Furthermore, referring

" Reaction conditions: aldehyde (0.250 mmol), amine (0.300 mmol), alkyne (0.325 mmol), catalyst (0.07 g), the reaction temperatures are 120, 150,
and 150 °℃ on 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts, respectively. 6The reaction time was not optimization. cGC

bearing electron-withdrawing groups (Table 1, entry 4) afforded
a better yield than those bearing electron-donating groups
(Table 1, entries 2 and 3) when 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 catalyst was
used, however, the employment of 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3 (Table 1,
entry 17 vs. 16) and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 (Table 1, entry 22 vs.
21) gave the opposite results. The A3 coupling reaction was
reported to be highly affected by the nature of aldehydes, and
the reactivity of aldehydes could be affected by the employed
catalyst. 4,6,14,22,29 Kidwai et al. found that aryl aldehydes posses-
sing electron-withdrawing groups afforded a better yield than
that with an electron-donating group bound to the benzene ring
which required longer reaction time with metallic Au nanoparti-
cles as catalyst.11 Wei and Li reported that both aromatic and ali-
phatic aldehydes were able to undergo the corresponding A3
coupling with the catalyst of AuBr3.4 They found that electron-
withdrawing groups displayed high reactivities, however, elec-
tron-rich groups bound to the benzene ring decreased the reactiv-
ity and required a longer reaction time. The decreased yield for
aliphatic aldehydes was caused by the trimerization of aliphatic
aldehydes with homogeneous gold salts. Zhang and Corma
found that benzaldehyde with electron-donating groups react
smoothly, while substitution of electron-withdrawing groups on
the benzene ring decreases the reactivity with the catalyst of
Au/CeO2.14 Based on the above results, we may presume that
the activity difference could be due to the different properties
(e.g., different oxidation states) between 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 and
0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts.

With the catalyst of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, the reaction with sec-
ondary amines proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding
propargylamines (Table 1, entries 1, 7-9). Among the various
amines tested, alicyclic amines such as piperidine, pyrrolidine,
and morpholine gave good conversions of benzaldehyde,
whereas the diethylamine afforded a lower conversion. This was
probably due to the iminium ions generated from alicyclic
amines and benzaldehyde which are more stable than that gener-
ated from dialkyl amine and benzaldehyde.

A variety of aromatic alkynes were coupled with benzaldehyde
and piperidine in the presence of the 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 catalyst.
It was found that straight-chain alkyl substituted phenylacetylene
showed decreasing conversion of benzaldehyde with increasing
chain length, the conversions were 86.4%, 70.6%, and 28.5% for
methyl, ethyl, and butyl phenylacetylene, respectively (Table 1,
entries 10-12). Clearly, when increasing the steric hindrance of
alkynes, it gave a decrease in conversion. The reaction was
found to be highly affected by the steric hindrance of the
alkynes, which was probably ascribed to the limitation effect of
the IRMOF-3 channels. Aliphatic alkynes such as 1-octyne and
(trimethylsilyl)acetylene also afforded moderate conversions of
benzaldehyde with 62.1% and 56.6%, respectively (Table 1,
entries 13 and 14).

The reusability studies of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 0.6%Au/
IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 were carried out on the A3
coupling reaction of benzaldehyde, piperidine, and phenylacety-
lene. The results are summarized in Table 2. The fresh 4.6%Au/

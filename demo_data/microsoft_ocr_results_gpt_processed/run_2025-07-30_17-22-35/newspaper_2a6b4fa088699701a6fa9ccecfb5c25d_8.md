the Service possessed information
indicating proposing to list the taxa was
possibly appropriate, but for which
conclusive data on biological
vulnerability and threats sufficient to
support a proposed listing rule was
lacking. Panicum hirstif remained a
Category 2 candidate species in the
subsequent plant notices of review in
1983, 1985, 1990, and 1993 (48 FR
53640, November 28, 1983; 50 FR
39526, September 27, 1985; 55 FR 6184,
February 21, 1990; 58 FR 51144,
September 30, 1993). The Service did
not publish any other notices of review
for plants during this time period.

The Service revised candidate
categories in 1996, and Panicum hirstii
was not included as a candidate species
under the updated categorization [61 FR
7596; February 28, 1996). The revised
categories further defined a candidate
species as a species for which we have
on file sufficient information on
biological vulnerability and threats to
support preparation of a listing
proposal, but for which development of
a listing regulation is precluded by other
higher-priority listing activities.

In 1999, the Service included
Panicum hirstif as a new candidate
species, using the updated definition,
through its own internal assessment
process (i.e., not via a petition), and
assigned it an LPN of 5, meaning it was
a species with a high magnitude of
nonimminent threats (64 FR 57534,
October 25, 1999). Panicum hirstif was
included in the subsequent annual
CNORs with an LPN of 5 in 2001, 2002,
and 2004 (66 FR 54808, October 30,
2001; 67 FR 40657, June 13, 2002; 69 FR
24876, May 4, 2004). The Service did
not publish a CNOR in 2003.

On May 11, 2004, we received a
petition dated May 4, 2004, from the
Center for Biological Diversity and other
groups and individuals requesting that
the Service list Panicum hirstif and 225
other candidate species as endangered
species or threatened species under the
Act. In 2005, the Service again made a
warranted-but-precluded finding for the
plant, with an LPN of 5, but noted a
change in its scientific name to
Dichanthelium hirstii (70 FR 24870,
May 11, 2005). In 2006 through 2014, D.
hirstif remained a candidate with an
LPN of 5 (see September 12, 2006 (71 FR
53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR
69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR
75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR
57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR
69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370).
November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994),
November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), and
December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450)). In
2015, D. hirstif was included as a
candidate in the CNOR, but the LPN

was elevated from 5 to 2, indicating a
species with a high magnitude of
imminent threats (80 FR 80584,
December 24, 2015).


# Background

Dichanthelium hirstii, as referenced
in some literature, is a perennial,
wetland-obligate grass that is currently
estimated to occur in eight locations
distributed across four States: New
Jersey (Barkwoods Pond, Labounsky
Pond, and Berlin Avenue Bogs North in
Atlantic County, and Hampton Furnace
Pond in Burlington County); Delaware
(Assawoman Pond in Sussex County);
North Carolina (Starretts Meadow and
Lyman Road in Onslow County): and
Georgia (Leslie Pond in Sumter County).
A ninth location, in Calhoun County,
Georgia, is considered historical.


# Summary of Status Review

The plant that the Service has been
referring to as either P. hirstif or D.
hirstif has always had a complex
taxonomic history, and has undergone
several changes to its scientific name as
understanding about its distribution and
morphology has evolved. The Flora of
North America (FNA) is one source of
information available to the Service and
is considered the taxonomic authority
for plants in North America because it
is a comprehensive, systematic
taxonomic account of the plants of
North America. While several authors
have published regional flora and
descriptions that recognize Panicum
hirstii/ Dichanthelium hirstii as a
separate entity, few have published
taxonomic treatments. The last
taxonomic treatment was the 2003 FNA,
which is a complete taxonomic
treatment of the Dichanthelium genus
and the species therein, that explicitly
relegates P. hirstii/D. hirstii to a
synonym of D. dichotomum ssp.
roanokense (Ashe). This indicates that
the plant the Service had considered a
candidate species is not a valid taxon
and is a component of a larger, more
widespread species that appears to grow
on the coastal plain from Delaware to
southeastern Texas and in the West
Indies. Although the Integrated
Taxonomic Information System (ITIS;
http://www.itis.gov/) reports that
Dichanthelium hirstii is an accepted
species and the Service often relies on
ITIS as a reliable database source of
taxonomic information, in this instance
ITIS is incorrect. Given this closer
review of the taxonomic history of P.
hirstii/D. hirstii, the Service recognizes
that we overlooked the significance of
the synonymy information, and in
retrospect should not have included P.
hirstif or D. hirstif as a candidate

species. While the 2015 published and
draft documents of McAvoy et al. and
Weakley, respectively, and the ITIS
database information are more recent
than the 2003 FNA's published
treatment, those documents and
database do not individually or
collectively represent a more
comprehensive systematic analysis of
the plant's taxonomic status because
they are not full taxonomic treatments
of Panicum and Dichanthelium.
Therefore, the Service considers the
FNA's 2003 treatment of Panicum and
Dichanthelium as representing the best
available scientific and commercial
information regarding the plant's
taxonomic status. The FNA's treatment
indicates that neither P. hirstii nor D.
hirstif is considered a species,
subspecies, or variety. Therefore, the
best available scientific and commercial
information indicates that P. hirstii/D.
hirstif does not meet the Act's definition
of a species.


# Finding

Based on the best available scientific
and commercial information, we find
that Dichanthelium hirstii does not meet
the Act's definition of "species" and is,
therefore, not a listable entity under the
Act. Dichanthelium hirstii was
subsumed into D. dichotomum ssp.
roanokense (Ashe), which "grows on
the coastal plain from Delaware to
southeastern Texas and in the West
Indies." As a result, we are removing
Dichanthelium hirstii from the
candidate list.

As a result of the Service's 2011
multidistrict litigation settlement with
the Center for Biological Diversity and
WildEarth Guardians, the Service is
required to submit a proposed listing
rule or a not-warranted 12-month
finding to the Federal Register by
September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered
Species Act Section 4 Deadline
Litigation, No. 10-377 (EGS), MDL
Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)).
for all 251 species that were included as
candidate species in the Service's
November 10, 2010, CNOR. This
document satisfies the requirements of
that settlement agreement for the Hirst
Brothers' panic grass, and constitutes
the Service's 12-month finding on the
May 4, 2004, petition to list the Hirst
Brothers' panic grass as an endangered
or threatened species. A detailed
discussion of the basis for this finding,
including a complete review of the
taxonomic history, can be found in the
Hirst Brothers' panic grass's species-
specific assessment form and other
supporting documents (see ADDRESSES,
above].

flathead sole Community Development
Quota (CDQ) for yellowfin sole CDQ
acceptable biological catch (ABC)
reserves in the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands management area. This action is
necessary to allow the 2016 total

management area to be harvested.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS
manages the groundfish fishery in the
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands
management area (BSAI) according to
the Fishery Management Plan for
Groundfish of the Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands Management Area
(FMP) prepared by the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council under
authority of the Magnuson-Stevens
Fishery Conservation and Management
Act. Regulations governing fishing by
U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP
appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600
and 50 CFR part 679.

The 2016 flathead sole and yellowfin
sole CDQ reserves specified in the BSAI

are 1,617 metric tons (mt), and 16,933
mt as established by the final 2016 and
2017 harvest specifications for
groundfish in the BSAI (81 FR 14773,
March 18, 2016) and following revision
(81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016). The
2016 flathead sole and yellowfin sole
CDQ ABC reserves are 5,472 mt and
5,719 mt as established by the final 2016
and 2017 harvest specifications for
groundfish in the BSAI (81 FR 14773,
March 18, 2016) and following revision
(81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016).

The Aleutian Pribilof Island
Community Development Association
has requested that NMFS exchange 80
mt of flathead sole CDQ reserves for 80
mt of yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves
under $ 679.31(d). Therefore, in
accordance with $ 679.31(d), NMFS
exchanges 80 mt of flathead sole CDQ
reserves for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ
ABC reserves in the BSAI. This action
also decreases and increases the TACs
and CDQ ABC reserves by the
corresponding amounts. Tables 11 and
13 of the final 2016 and 2017 harvest
specifications for groundfish in the
BSAI (81 FR 14773, March 18, 2016),
and following revision (81 FR 64782,
September 21, 2016), are revised as
follows:

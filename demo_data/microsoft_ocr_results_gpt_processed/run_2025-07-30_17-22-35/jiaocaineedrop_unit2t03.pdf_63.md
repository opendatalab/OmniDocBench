# Before You Read The Minister's Black Veil


## Meet Nathaniel Hawthorne

"I don't want to be a doctor,
and live by men's diseases; nor a
minister to live by their sins;
nor a lawyer to live by their
quarrels. So I don't see there's
anything left for me but to be
an author."

Hawthorne

Thus, some may say, Nathaniel Hawthorne became
one of the United States' great writers by default.

Hawthorne was born in the port town of Salem,
Massachusetts. When Hawthorne was only four,
his father, a sea captain, died of yellow fever in
South America. Raised by his eccentric, reclusive
mother, young Hawthorne became an avid reader
of poetry and exotic adventure stories.

At age seventeen Hawthorne began his four
years at Bowdoin College in Maine. His friends
there included a future president and a future poet:
Franklin Pierce and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

After graduating from Bowdoin, Hawthorne
sought seclusion in Salem, where he spent twelve
years studying Puritan history and developing his
writing skills. Out of those twelve years came two
books, a novel called Fanshawe and a collection of
short stories called Twice-Told Tales. Fanshawe was
never popular-Hawthorne himself destroyed all
the copies he could find-but reviewers praised
Twice-Told Tales, and the book enjoyed a modest
success with the public.

In his writing, Hawthorne explored issues of
moral and social responsibility in Puritan New
England. He hated intolerance, hypocrisy, and any
other sentiment that separated one from the rest of
humanity. Hawthorne explored these issues in tales
he called "allegories of the heart"-stories that
teach a moral principle.

In fact, Hawthorne's own deep
family roots in Puritan Salem
haunted the writer throughout
his life. Hawthorne's ancestors
included a man who had perse-
cuted Quakers and one of the
judges who had condemned the
Salem "witches" in 1692.
Hawthorne himself was keenly
aware of issues of sin and guilt.

At the age of thirty-eight,
Hawthorne married Sophia
Peabody and moved to the Old Manse, the house
in Concord, Massachusetts, where writer Ralph
Waldo Emerson had lived. However, unable to
support his family as a writer, Hawthorne returned
to Salem. There he served as Surveyor of the Port
but lost the job when the political administration
changed. Hawthorne then began writing The
Scarlet Letter. This novel, published when
Hawthorne was forty-six, was a sensation. He
followed up the success with another novel,
The House of the Seven Gables.

In 1853, when his friend Franklin Pierce
became president of the United States, Hawthorne
was awarded the position of U.S. consul to the city
of Liverpool, England. He held that position for
four years. Then he toured Italy and returned to
England to write his last complete novel, The
Marble Faun. By 1860, he returned to the United
States-in ill health, struggling to continue writing,
and despondent. Four years later, while traveling
with Franklin Pierce, Hawthorne died in his sleep.

"Mr. Hawthorne's distinctive trait is invention,
creation, imagination."

-Edgar Allan Poe

"What other dungeon is so dark as one's own
heart! What jailer so inexorable as one's self!"

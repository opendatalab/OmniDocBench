believed to be affecting the species at
present, it appears many of them were
largely historical, were less significant
than previously thought, have been
mitigated, or could be managed to
alleviate many of the effects on the
species. The sicklefin redhorse sucker
likely experienced substantial range
contraction associated with dam
construction, power generation, and
historical habitat degradation early in
the 20th century, but the remaining
populations appear to have stabilized
within the present conditions and are
successfully spawning and recruiting in
four primary river drainages accessible
from Hiwassee and Fontana Reservoirs.

In the future, we expect human
population growth and land
development to be primary factors
affecting habitat quality in the range of
the sicklefin redhorse sucker. However,
compared to historical land use effects,
we expect the effect of these future
activities to be minimized by more
stringent State and local land quality
regulations, such as are required by
current regulations for land
development and water quality, and a
trend of diminishing agriculture in the
area. Improvements in land use
practices are likely attributable to the
modern regulatory environment that
provides protection to the stream
environment. The Fish and Wildlife
Coordination Act of 1934 (16 U.S.C. 661
et seg.), North Carolina Environmental
Policy Act of 1971, Clean Water Act of
1972 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), North
Carolina Sediment and Pollution
Control Act of 1973, Georgia Erosion
and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as well
as other regulatory actions, were
enacted to control the effects of land
development and pollution on the
aquatic environment. Historical records
indicate that the existing populations of
the sicklefin redhorse sucker have
persisted through significant
agricultural land disturbance that
resulted in considerable sedimentation
of its habitat, indicating that the
sicklefin redhorse sucker is likely able
to tolerate moderate land disturbance.
Rural development and the growth of
several small towns within the range of
the sicklefin redhorse sucker appear to
be the dominant forms of land use
disturbance. Rural development is
limited in certain areas due to large
portions of the watershed that are
permanently protected by inclusion in
the Nantahala and Chattahoochee
National Forests. The region is currently
experiencing a trend of diminishing
agricultural land use, indicating that
widespread conversion to farmland is
not likely. Commercial development is

likely to be limited by a lack of large
metropolitan areas or interstate
highways that would facilitate rapid
growth. The trend of high suspended
sediment yield in the range of the
sicklefin redhorse sucker appears to
have improved over the last few
decades. Increasing environmental
regulation, greater public awareness,
and the actions of governmental and
nongovernmental organizations to
improve water quality conditions have
resulted in considerable improvements
in suspended sediment rates. Therefore,
we expect existing regulations for land
development and water quality to
adequately maintain habitat quality, and
we anticipate that the species is likely
to persist into the future even with the
expected increase in development.

The sicklefin redhorse sucker is
provided additional protection by State
endangered species regulations and
association with other federally listed
species. It is listed as threatened by the
State of North Carolina and endangered
by the State of Georgia. Both States
prohibit direct take of the species and
the collection of the fish for scientific
purposes without a valid State
collecting permit. In the unimpounded
portions of the mainstems of the Little
Tennessee River and Tuckasegee River
where the sicklefin redhorse sucker
occurs, the species' habitat is indirectly
provided Federal protection through the
Act, where the mainstem portions of
both of these rivers are designated as
critical habitat for the endangered
Appalachian elktoe (Alasmidonta
raveneliana] (a mussel). In addition to
the Appalachian elktoe, the portion of
the Little Tennessee River where the
sicklefin redhorse sucker occurs also
supports populations of the endangered
little-wing pearlymussel (Pegias fabula)
and the threatened spotfin chub
[Erimonax monachus] and is also
designated as critical habitat for the
spotfin chub.

Substantial public land ownership in
the watersheds occupied by the
sicklefin redhorse sucker provides
partial protection to the watershed.
Approximately 43 percent of the land
adjacent to waterways occupied this
species is owned by State and Federal
agencies or by nongovernmental
conservation organizations. On these
conserved properties, land development
is prohibited, providing protection to
buffers and potentially improving water
quality throughout the watershed. Most
of the land surrounding Hiwassee and
Fontana Lakes is publicly owned,
limiting shoreline development and
protecting the near shore habitat used
by juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers.
The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians

has management jurisdiction over a
portion of the lands within both the
Hiwassee River and Tuckasegee River
watersheds, and tribal water quality
ordinances protect habitat and water
quality. Approximately 65 percent of
the occupied area of the Little
Tennessee River is protected from
development by inclusion in the
Needmore Game Lands. Along the other
three major spawning tributaries, most
of the land is privately held and does
not have any restriction on land
development.

When the sicklefin redhorse sucker
was elevated to candidate status in
2005, the blueback herring, an invasive
predator species, had been inadvertently
introduced into the Hiwassee Reservoir,
a major waterbody supporting the
sicklefin redhorse sucker. At the time,
predation of young sicklefin redhorse
sucker by blueback herring was an
unassessed threat. However, a recent
study examining the gut contents of
blueback herring in the Valley River and
Hiwassee Reservoir failed to find any
sicklefin redhorse suckers among the
samples. It appears that the sicklefin
redhorse sucker may naturally avoid
predation by blueback herring by
spawning farther upstream than typical
foraging habitat for blueback herring. In
the spring of 2016, blueback herring
were collected from Fontana Reservoir,
the other reservoir important for
sicklefin redhorse sucker recruitment.
Further investigation is required to
determine the degree of impact the
presence of blueback herring in Fontana
Reservoir poses to the sicklefin redhorse
sucker, but the distance to spawning
sites upstream of Fontana Reservoir is
similar to the distance in the Hiwassee
Reservoir, suggesting that blueback
herring will be similarly separated from
the hatching sicklefin redhorse sucker
fry during the time when they are most
likely to be present in the reservoir.
Collections in the Hiwassee River
system in 2014-2015 produced many
young adult/late juvenile sicklefin
redhorse suckers that have clearly
recruited since the herring invasion,
even while juvenile walleye and white
bass steeply declined immediately after
the invasion, suggesting the blueback
herring is not preventing successful
recruitment of sicklefin redhorse
suckers. Therefore, recent observations
indicate that blueback herring have not
proven to be a threat to the sicklefin
redhorse sucker as once feared.

Many of the stressors that may affect
the sicklefin redhorse sucker in the
future can be further minimized by
conservation actions carried out under
the recently signed OCA among the

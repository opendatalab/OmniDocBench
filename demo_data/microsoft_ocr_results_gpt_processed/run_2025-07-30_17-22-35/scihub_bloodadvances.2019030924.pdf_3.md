Obs, observed.

*P values to test differences in SIRs across NHL subtypes were computed using likelihood ratio test derived from Poisson regression models adjusted for age at first primary NHL, sex,
and latency, with log of expected numbers of cases included as offset. Exact numbers of cases are not reported for categories with <5 observed cases to maintain patient confidentiality.
All statistical tests were 2 sided.

+SIRs and exact Poisson-based 95% CIs compared number of observed cases with that expected in general population (additional details provided in "Methods").

we observed significantly elevated SIRs among gastric MZL
survivors (SIR, 6.70; 95% CI, 4.34-9.90) but not among non-
gastric extranodal MZL survivors (SIR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.80-3.06;
P heterogeneity <.01; Figure 1) or nodal MZL survivors (data not
shown; SIR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.68-2.81). This risk after gastric MZL
was similar across treatments (data not shown; SIR range, 5.98-
9.15). Likewise, the SIR for stomach cancer was significantly
increased after gastric DLBCL (SIR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.07-5.50) but
not after nongastric extranodal DLBCL (SIR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.77-
2.11), although the SIRs did not differ significantly (P heterogeneity =
.12). Additionally, the SIR for stomach cancer was elevated among
survivors of nodal DLBCL (SIR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.06-2.05). In sec-
ondary analyses stratifying DLBCL survivors by HIV/AIDS status at
the time of diagnosis, the risk of anal cancer was much more strongly
elevated among those with known HIV/AIDS (SIR, 68.34; 95% CI,
37.36-114.66) than those without known HIV/AIDS (SIR, 2.09; 95%
CI, 1.22-3.34; Table 3).

Additional analyses of the most commonly occurring second
cancers (liver and stomach cancers) evaluated SIR patterns by
patient subgroup (Tables 4 and 5). In general, SIRs were largely
consistent across age at first primary NHL diagnosis, sex, time
since first primary NHL diagnosis, stage of first primary NHL,
and initial treatment of first primary NHL, but there were a few
exceptions. For stomach cancer (Table 4), the only indication of
borderline heterogeneity was by stage for MZL survivors (early
stage: SIR, 3.79; advanced stage: SIR, 2.00; P heterogeneity =
.07); notably, a majority of early-stage MZL cases (n = 21 of 31)
were gastric MZL. For liver cancer (Table 5), the SIR among
DLBCL survivors diagnosed before age 60 years was higher
than that among patients diagnosed with DLBCL at older ages
(SIR, 2.89 vs 1.21; P heterogeneity < .01) and during the first
5 years after DLBCL compared with later periods (SIR, 2.23 vs
1.32; P heterogeneity <.01). Liver cancer SIRs after DLBCL and
MZL were significantly elevated only among males, but differences
by sex were not statistically significant (DLBCL: SIR, 1.96 vs 1.48;
P heterogeneity > .50; MZL: SIR, 2.32 vs 1.14; P heterogeneity = .16).
Additionally, although there was no overall increase in liver cancer
after FL, the SIR was significantly elevated highest among FL
survivors who received initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy
(SIR, 2.53; P heterogeneity = .02), based on 7 observed cases. Across

NHL subtypes, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the
SIRs for stomach or liver cancers by calendar year period of NHL
diagnosis (data not shown).


Figure 1. Risk for developing second primary stomach cancer among adult
1-year DLBCL and MZL survivors by site of DLBCL or MZL, 2000 to 2014. SIRs
and exact Poisson-based 95% CIs compared the number of observed cases with that
expected in the general population (additional details provided in "Methods"). P values
to test differences in the SIRs were computed using a likelihood ratio test derived
from Poisson regression models stratified by age at first primary NHL, sex, and latency,
with the log of the expected numbers of cases included as an offset. All statistical
tests were 2 sided. Created using GraphPad Prism (version 7; La Jolla, CA).

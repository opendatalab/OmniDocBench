# Attitudes towards Rainwater Harvesting


## Annex 1: Letter and questionnaire to donor organisations

Dear water professional,

I'm writing this letter in the hope that you may be able to assist us in our research programme, called
"Domestic Roofwater Harvesting in the Humid Tropics". It is a 3-year-programme to generate reliable
information for water policy planners, water supply professionals and ultimately householders. The
programme just started and is funded by the EU. It involves 4 partners from India, Sri Lanka, England
and Germany. Links are being developed with practitioners in Central America and East Africa.
The programme will examine literature and practice from many parts of the world, but it is expected
that those from humid tropical areas will be of most use, since Domestic Rainwater Harvesting
technology and economics are dominated by factors like climate and culture.

In the view of water resources getting scarce, it is becoming obvious that we should use every
available water resource as e.g. rainwater. Rainwater harvesting has been and is successfully
practised for millennia around the Mediterranean as a supplementary source of water or the only one
available. In many countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, it is currently newly introduced or its
use widened. One of several components of the programme is to define the information needs of
organisations active in the water sector. We would therefore like to ask you about your funding policy
for the water sector and how it is implemented in the different countries.

We will compile our research findings (we just have started) and will make them available to you if you
wish so. They will also be available on a web site, which will soon be established. Please feel free to
contact me for any additional information you might want to get.

Thanking you in advance for your time and efforts invested

\- also in the name of the other partners involved

# Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test 

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital $>$ rufinamide $>>$ valproate $=$ ethosuximide $>>$ phenytoin (Table 1). Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. In slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital $>$ rufinamide $>$ ethosuximide $>>$ valproate $>>>$ phenytoin (Table 2).

Oral rufinamide ( $\geq 1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) and phenytoin ( 800 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

## Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure tests ( $\mathrm{ED}_{50} \sim 50-75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) and showed partial protection from strychnine-induced tonic seizures ( $37.5 \%$ protection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbital $\geq$ rufinamide $>>$ valproate $=$ ethosuximide $>$ phenytoin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test, phenytoin had the lowest $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ value, suggesting the greatest potency. However, it is important to note that $50 \%$ protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Phenytoin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.

## Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide $\left(\mathrm{TD}_{50}\right)$ in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was $500-1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. The $\mathrm{TD}_{50}$ for rufinamide was higher than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not assessed due the low $\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ values and high protective index $(>40)$.

Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperitoneal rufinamide ( $1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}, \mathrm{n}=2 ; \mathrm{ED}_{50} 15-100$ $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the comparator drugs induced increased side effects ( $2 \times \mathrm{TD}_{50}$ ) and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-24 h ( $4 \times \mathrm{TD}_{50}$ ). The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice ( $\mathrm{TD}_{3} / \mathrm{ED}_{97}>19.2$ [intraperitoneal] and $>23.8$ [oral]) was consistently greater than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice $\left(\mathrm{HD}_{50}\right)$ was $>500$ and $<1,000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (Table 5). Rufinamide had a numerically greater $\mathrm{HD}_{50}$ value than phenytoin or phenobarbital $\left(\mathrm{HD}_{50}\right.$ values of 178 and $135 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, respectively). Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable

(underlined), 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and 5'-GTCACCATGGGCTGGTCCGATTCTGCC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI, then inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pNI6 encoding the hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI with the amino-acid substitution G103D, the mutated $n l p I$ in the chromosomal DNA of Rev3 (spr-1 nlpI3) was amplified by PCR using the primers described above, and the amplified DNA was digested with the NcoI and inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pNI7 encoding the truncated and hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI, the fragment containing the truncated $n l p I$ was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer 5'-GGTCCATGGGGTCCTGGCCC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with $N c o I$, then inserted into the same site of pBAD $M y c$ His C. pNI8 and pNI9 were constructed in the same way as pNI7 except that 5'-CATCCATGGCCTGGCCCAGG-3' or 5'-CTTCCATGGGGCCCAGGAGC-3', respectively, was used as the reverse primer in PCR. To construct pNI10 encoding NlpI, the $n l p I$ in the chromosomal DNA of W3110 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer containing the NcoI site (underlined) 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer containing the BamHI site (underlined) 5'-TGGATCCGGCTCAAAGTAGG-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the same sites of pTrc99A. pNI12, pNI13, and pNI14 were constructed in the same way as pNI10 except that 5'-CCAGGGATCCTTAGTCCTGGCC-3', 5'-GTCAGGATCCTACTGGCCCAG-
$3^{\prime}$, or 5'-ATCTGGATCCTAGCCCAGGAG-3', respectively, was used as the reverse primer containing the BamHI site (underlined) in PCR. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into the same sites of pTrc99A.

Expression and Purification of Hexa-Histidine-Tagged NlpI Protein-E. coli cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids. The transformants were grown in L broth at $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 h , then incubated in L broth containing $0.01 \%$ arabinose at $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 h for expression of the fusion genes. Cells from 400 ml of medium were collected, washed once with ice-cold 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 8.0 ) containing 300 mM NaCl (buffer A), suspended in 4 ml of the buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole and $1 \%$ Triton X-100, and disrupted by sonication with cooling by ice-water. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at $17,700 \times g$ to obtain a clear lysate. Four milliliters of the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin and incubated with rotation for 2 h at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The mixture was loaded onto an open column. The column was washed with 4 ml each of buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole and then containing 40 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with 1.2 ml of buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis-An electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DECA XP ion trap mass system, Thermo Electron) coupled online with a capillary HPLC (Magic 2002, Michrom BioResources) was used to acquire MS/MS spectra. A $0.2 \times 50 \mathrm{~mm}$ MAGICMS C18

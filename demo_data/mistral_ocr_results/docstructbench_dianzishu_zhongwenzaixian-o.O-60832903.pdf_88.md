The little person made a bob-curtsey-"Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!" And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.
"What's that thing?" said Lucie-"that's not my pocket-handkin?"
"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waistcoat belonging to Cock Robin!"

And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.

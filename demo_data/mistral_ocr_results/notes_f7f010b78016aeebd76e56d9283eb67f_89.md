"Why do you buy things here?"Tracy wanted to know. "Because they are cheaper here than at the corner store near our home." Mis Wilson said. "Help me check the prices, ghase."

The Wiskons were not rich and Mis Wilson was abay careful with her money. She looked carefully at the prices of things. She bought lots of things in the supermarket. When they got home, the chaldren said, "We don't think you saved money by going to the supermarket." "Of course I did." Mis Wilson said "Everything was cheaper."

Each spring requires a 0.4 N force to extend or compress it by 1.0 cm .
(c) What steady force is needed to move the pointer 2.0 cm from $O$ ?
(d) What steady acceleration is required to move the pointer in (c)?

The car starts from rest at time $t=0$ and travels along a straight road. The accelerometer readings are recorded in Table 14.

| Time $/ \mathrm{s}$ | Acceleration $/ \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ |
| :--: | :--: |
| $0.00-3.00$ | 11.00 |
| $3.00-4.50$ | 7.00 |
| $4.50-7.00$ | 0.00 |

Table 14
(e) How fast is the car travelling after 7.00 s ?
(f) How far does the car travel in the first 7.00 s ?
(g) Aeroplanes are fitted with three accelerometers as part of their navigation equipment. Why are three accelerometers needed?

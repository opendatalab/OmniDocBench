Table II. Chemical Compositions of Iron-Rich Intermetallics in the As-Cast and SHTed Conditions

| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Conditions | Iron-Rich Intermetallics | Al | Si | Mn | Fe | Cu |
| As-cast | $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$ | $70.92 \pm 0.76$ | $7.8 \pm 0.35$ | $3.15 \pm 0.25$ | $13.21 \pm 0.42$ | $4.91 \pm 0.24$ |

contents of Mn and Si , which is consistent with the literature. ${ }^{[16,30]}$ After being SHTed for 8 hours, almost the entire amount of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{Cu}$ is dissolved into the Al matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$ phase becomes unstable and is transformed into a small amount of short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmentation of the $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in Table II. It can be found that higher Al contents are detected in the $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$ and STed $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}$ after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contribution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small sizes of the fragmented $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$ and STed $\beta$-Fe particles after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition, it can be found that the iron content in $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$ is reduced after

SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of 0.452 , lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical for an accurate solution, ${ }^{[31]}$ indicate that this phase is still the $\alpha-\mathrm{Fe}$ (body-centered cubic with $a, b$, and $c$ as $1.265 \mathrm{~nm}^{[11]}$ ). Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical composition to the $\beta$-Fe obtained in the as-cast condition (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-transformed $\beta$-Fe (STed $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}$ ) to distinguish it from the $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}$ directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidification. The formation of the STed $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}$ is further confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by EBSD (Figure 2(d)), The STed $\beta$-Fe is most likely to have the same crystal structure as the solidified $\beta$-Fe (tetragonal with a and b of 0.634 nm and c of $1.488 \mathrm{~nm}^{[11]}$ ) due to their similar diffraction patterns. However, the STed $\beta$-Fe has lower Cu content than the $\beta$-Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the Cu by Al

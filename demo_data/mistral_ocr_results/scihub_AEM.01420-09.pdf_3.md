[^0](data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mutant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of growth $\left(\mu \max _{\mathrm{w} t}, 0.14 ; \mu \max _{\Delta c r t X}, 0.22 ; \mu \max _{\Delta c r t E}, 0.24 ;\right.$ and $\left.\mu \max _{\Delta c r t Y}, 0.19 ; P=0.000\right)$.

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing $\Delta c r t E$, $\Delta c r t X$, and $\Delta c r t Y$ in LB and M9 medium at $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (for results in M9, see Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, no significant dif-
ferences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for $\Delta c r t Y, \Delta c r t E$, and $\Delta c r t X$ in both LB and M9 compared to those of the wild type (in LB, $\mu \max _{\mathrm{wt}}=0.04, \mu \max _{\Delta c r t X}=0.03$, $\mu \max _{\Delta c r t E}=0.03$, and $\mu \max _{\Delta c r t Y}=0.04$; in M9, $\mu \max _{\mathrm{wt}}=$ $0.01, \mu \max _{\Delta c r t X}=0.01, \mu \max _{\Delta c r t E}=0.01$, and $\mu \max _{\Delta c r t Y}=$ 0.01 ).

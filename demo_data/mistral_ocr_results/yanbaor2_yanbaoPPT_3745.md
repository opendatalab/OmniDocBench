By contrast, in China, consumers were less likely to switch stores to save money. Instead, they opted to buy their preferred brand in smaller quantities. Globally, almost one in four consumers said they do this. Many consumer-goods companies have in troduced smaller pack sizes, allowing consumers to sample-and, in time, become loyal to-established brands. Colgate-Palmolive, for instance, has long sold its oral-care and household products in small packets and sachets. In Central and West Africa, Nestlé launched an initiative called My Own Business, through which entrepreneurs sell hot coffee by the cup from specially designed backpacks. The initiative has made loyal Nescafé drinkers out of consumers who might not be able to afford an entire tin of instant coffee.

## The waning appeal of 'natural' and 'organic'

Worldwide, 31 percent more consumers said they're eating healthier food, continuing a trend we've observed over the past two years. However, the latest survey results also show that consumers today aren't necessarily equating healthy eating with buying products that are labeled "natural" or "organic."

In Western Europe, there is still some growth in natural and organic products. For example, in Italy and France, survey respondents who claimed to have increased their purchases of natural and organic products outnumbered those who said they'd reduced such purchases, by 13 percent. Western European consumers are also continuing to show greater interest in buying locally sourced food.

But in the United States, consumers seemed not to be too concerned about whether food products are labeled either natural or organic, or whether they're locally sourced. Instead, among US consumers, eating healthy increasingly means carefully reading nutrition information and ingredient lists. This is in part because more US consumers are adhering to a specific "food lifestyle"; another recent McKinsey survey showed that 10 percent of consumers across all age groups say they stick to a low-carb or high-protein diet (Exhibit 3). Some consumers eat only dairy-free foods. Other food lifestyles include gluten-free, vegetarian, and paleo.

CPG companies are responding to this trend, either by launching new products and brands of their own or by acquiring smaller, fast-growing health-and-wellness players. General Mills now has nearly 1,000 gluten-free options in the US market alone. Mars took a minority stake in KIND Snacks, which was among the first companies to participate in the "clean labeling" movement (meaning that its list of ingredients is typically short, simple, and contains no artificial additives).

Our annual survey provides a snapshot of consumer sentiment and evolving consumer behavior, with important nuances by country and region. Companies that stay keenly attuned to how consumers are feeling and how they are making purchase decisions will be best able to plan forand capture-profitable growth.

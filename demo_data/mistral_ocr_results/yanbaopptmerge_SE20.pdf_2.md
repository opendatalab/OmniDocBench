## Defect Amplification Model

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

- Assume that an error uncovered during **design** will cost **1.5** monetary unit to correct. Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just **before testing** commences will cost **6.5** units; **during testing**, **15** units; and **after release**, between **67** and **100** units.
- A number of studies indicate that **design activities** introduce between **50%** - **65%** of all errors during the software process. However, **formal review technique** have been shown to be up to **75%** effective in uncovering design flaws.

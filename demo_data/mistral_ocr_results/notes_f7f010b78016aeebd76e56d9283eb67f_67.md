(1) When, while, as都表示"当…时", When 从句谓语动词取可从复词语词动词而可从复动读性动词, 可用于主从句动作同时发生或从句动作先于主的动作发生。while 从句谓语动词只能是动读性动词，确定主从句动作同时发生。as 引导一个持读性动作，当用于主从句动作同时发生，强调"…也……也"。 (2) until 用法：当主句谓语动词是连读性动词时，主从句却用着变式，语力"直到…力"；当主句谓语动词是调用的动词时，主句用来变式，从句用着变式，即not…until，语力"直到…才"。

because "因为" 语句最强，回答 Why 规则时只能用 because，或引导的从句可独立句首调句末；as "由于"、since "既然" 语句不如 because 强，引导的从句弯置于句首； for 显开句首词，语句最强，对斯指分句如从顺转成非合规则，或引导的分句弯置于句末，自用盖或隔开。
[注意] because 5 so 不能同时使用

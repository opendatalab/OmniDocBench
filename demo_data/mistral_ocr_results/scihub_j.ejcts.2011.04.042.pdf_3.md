Tertile groups. Plotting survival to the end of the follow-up period (Fig. 2 and Table 3) showed that there was no statistically significant difference in long-term survival between the three tertile groups (log-rank $p=0.13$ ).

Of the 104 patients who had received an ambulatory bloodpressure analysis during their follow-up period, 25 (18.4\%) were hypertensive and receiving treatment for it. On Kaplan-Meier analysis of freedom from hypertension from the time of hospital discharge to date of last ambulatory blood-pressure measurement, there was no difference between the three weight groups (log-rank $p=0.39$ ) (Fig. 3).

## Secondary outcome measures

Data on postoperative RV function was available in 158 out of 161 patients. Thirty-eight patients (24\%) developed RV failure. In the lower tertile group, $18.9 \%$ developed postoperative RV failure, in the middle group $24.5 \%$ and in the upper tertile group $28.8 \%$; this was not statistically different $(p=0.48)$ (Table 3).
The mean period of ventilation post transplant was 302.7 h (SD 617.8), median 102 h (IQR298). On Spearman's rank correlation, this was not associated with the donor/recipient weight ratio (Fig. 3) $(p=-0.12, p=0.14)$. Even when excluding the 11 patients who had been intubated for more than 100 h , there was no association $(p=-0.10, p=0.38)$ (Fig. 4).

The mean period of ITU stay was 448 h (SD 749.2), median 184 h (IQR374). On Spearman's rank correlation, this was also not related to the weight ratio $(p=-0.04, p=0.58)$ (Fig. 5). Again, if the six patients who were in the ITU for more than 2000 h were excluded, there was still no association ( $p<0.01, p=0.98$ ).

## Extreme mismatch subgroup

There were nine patients in whom the donor-recipient weight mismatch was 3 or greater (5.5\%). By the end of the follow-up period, there was only $11 \%(1 / 9)$ mortality, compared with $18.2 \%(23 / 126)$ for those with a ratio of $<3(p=0.76)$.

At the end of the follow-up period, of the six patients with 'extreme' mismatch who had been investigated with ambulatory blood-pressure measurement, only one was being treated for

The COVID-19 pandemic gave tax administrations a taste of what digital transformation can offer. But it also created challenges that could have been prevented had they transformed before. Now, they have an opportunity to realize far bigger possibilities - from giving taxpayers a more tailored experience to being an integral part of a seamless digital state.

In our second piece on the digital state, we look at the exciting possibilities transformation offers tax administrations globally.

## In brief

- Tax administrations know that digital transformation is necessary. But its potential extends far beyond fighting fires in a pandemic to improving life for citizens.
- Tax administrators can realize big benefits by designing customer-centric services, integrating digital into modernization programs and exchanging data in real time.

From launching digital platforms to serve struggling businesses to partnering with social services to deliver benefits, they've dramatically upped the pace of digital transformation. They've also recognized that digital will be key to meeting their challenges, including uncertain revenue projections and the growing need to finance budget deficits.

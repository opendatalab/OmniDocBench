# What should you consider when selecting a NB to issue your NBOp? 

The introduction of the MDR brought about more stringent requirements for NBs to meet to get their designation. As a result, the number of NBs designated for medical device certification has reduced to less than half (currently 23 MDRdesignated NBs) compared with the number available for the MDD.

When selecting a NB to issue an NBOp, consider several factors:

## Is the NB designated to provide services for your

device class? NBs have a designated scope of devices that they can provide service for. NBOG codes are assigned to different device classes and are used to determine the scope of the NB's designation. An integral DDC manufacturer should determine the codes that apply to their device part and verify that the prospective NB is designated for those codes.

## Does the NB have experience with providing

NBOps? As NBOp is a new requirement, the experience that NBs have with them may be limited. Therefore, to ensure a more frictionless process, it will be important for an integrated DDC manufacturer to understand the NB's experience when undergoing its selection process.

Do you have existing relationships with the NB? Due to the reduction in available NBs, the workload for the remaining NBs has increased significantly. As a result, many NBs face significant backlogs and are limiting the number of new customers they take on. Where possible, it may be advantageous for an integral DDC manufacturer to leverage its existing relationships.

How much is the NB charging to provide the NBOp, and is it within your budget? As NBs are independent organizations, the cost for their services, including an NBOp, varies from one NB to another. An integral DDC manufacturer should obtain quotes from a variety of prospective NBs to ensure that the cost is acceptable based on the service provided.

What are the NBs' proposed timelines for the NBOp process? NBs will have different estimated timelines for the NBOp process. For example, BSI has stated that their estimated timelines are six to nine months, and they do not offer expedited service. Therefore, it is important for an integral DDC manufacturer to plan ahead when it comes to NBOps to minimize the impact that these timelines could have on the overall MAA submission.

It is useful to note that you do not need to use the same NB for all your NBOps. However, securing a NB will require extensive vendor management activities that may further burden the manufacturer. Therefore, if you know that you will require several NBOps for multiple integral DDCs, it may help to agree upfront with a single NB for them to carry out the work and then plan the activities accordingly.

Streamlining the NBOp process as much as possible will be key. Additionally, some NBs may offer pre-
submission meetings to agree on timelines and the level of documentation they will require for their review, which could help to accelerate the overall process.

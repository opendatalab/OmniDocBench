# SKELETAL MUSCLE PAIRS

To move bones in opposite directions, skeletal muscles often consist
of muscle pairs that work in opposition to one another. For example,
when the biceps muscle (on the front of the upper arm) contracts, it
can cause the elbow joint to flex or bend the arm, as shown in Figure
6.3.5. When the triceps muscle (on the back of the upper arm)
contracts, it can cause the elbow to extend or straighten the arm. The

biceps and triceps muscles are examples of a muscle pair where the
muscles work in opposition to each other.


Figure 6.3.5: Triceps and biceps muscles in the upper arm are
opposing muscles that move the arm at the elbow in opposite
directions.

# SKELETAL MUSCLE STRUCTURE

Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds - or even thousands -
of skeletal muscle fibers, which are long, string-like cells. As shown
in Figure 6.3.6, skeletal muscle fibers are individually wrapped in
connective tissue called endomysium. The skeletal muscle fibers are
bundled together in units called muscle fascicles, surrounded by
sheaths of connective tissue called perimysium. Each fascicle
contains between ten and 100 (or even more!) skeletal muscle fibers.
Fascicles, in turn, are bundled together to form individual skeletal
muscles, which are wrapped in connective tissue called epimysium.
The connective tissues in skeletal muscles have a variety of
functions. They support and protect muscle fibers, allowing them to
withstand contraction forces by distributing the forces applied to the
muscle. They also provide pathways for nerves and blood vessels to
reach the muscles. Also, the epimysium anchors the muscles to
tendons.


Figure 6.3.6: Each skeletal muscle has a structure of bundles within
bundles. Bundles of muscle fibers make up a muscle fascicle, and
fascicles' bundles make up a skeletal muscle. At each level of
bundling, a connective tissue membrane surrounds the bundle. The
muscle cells, fascicle, and the whole muscle are surrounded by
Endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium, respectively. All
connective tissues merge together to make a tendon that attaches the
muscle to bones.

By contrast, in China, consumers were less likely
to switch stores to save money. Instead, they opted
to buy their preferred brand in smaller quantities.
Globally, almost one in four consumers said
they do this. Many consumer-goods companies
have in troduced smaller pack sizes, allowing
consumers to sample-and, in time, become
loyal to- established brands. Colgate-Palmolive,
for instance, has long sold its oral-care and
household products in small packets and sachets.
In Central and West Africa, Nestlé launched an
initiative called My Own Business, through which
entrepreneurs sell hot coffee by the cup from
specially designed backpacks. The initiative has
made loyal Nescafé drinkers out of consumers
who might not be able to afford an entire tin of
instant coffee.


# The waning appeal of 'natural' and ‘organic’

Worldwide, 31 percent more consumers said
they're eating healthier food, continuing a trend
we've observed over the past two years. However,
the latest survey results also show that consumers
today aren't necessarily equating healthy eating
with buying products that are labeled "natural" or
"organic."

In Western Europe, there is still some growth in
natural and organic products. For example, in Italy
and France, survey respondents who claimed to
have increased their purchases of natural and
organic products outnumbered those who said
they'd reduced such purchases, by 13 percent.
Western European consumers are also continuing
to show greater interest in buying locally sourced
food.

But in the United States, consumers seemed
not to be too concerned about whether food
products are labeled either natural or organic, or
whether they're locally sourced. Instead, among
US consumers, eating healthy increasingly
means carefully reading nutrition information
and ingredient lists. This is in part because more
US consumers are adhering to a specific "food
lifestyle": another recent McKinsey survey showed
that 10 percent of consumers across all age groups
say they stick to a low-carb or high- protein diet
(Exhibit 3). Some consumers eat only dairy-free
foods. Other food lifestyles include gluten-free,
vegetarian, and paleo.

CPG companies are responding to this trend,
either by launching new products and brands of
their own or by acquiring smaller, fast-growing
health-and-wellness players. General Mills now
has nearly 1,000 gluten-free options in the US
market alone. Mars took a minority stake in KIND
Snacks, which was among the first companies
to participate in the "clean labeling" movement
(meaning that its list of ingredients is typically
short, simple, and contains no artificial additives).

Our annual survey provides a snapshot of
consumer sentiment and evolving consumer
behavior, with important nuances by country and
region. Companies that stay keenly attuned to how
consumers are feeling and how they are making
purchase decisions will be best able to plan for-
and capture-profitable growth.

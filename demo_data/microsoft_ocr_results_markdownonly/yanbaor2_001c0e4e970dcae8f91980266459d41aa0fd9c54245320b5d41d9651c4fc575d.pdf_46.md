Medtech companies can no longer rely on previous
business models to drive growth and should
adapt.308 For example, the rise of ambulatory
surgery centers (ASCs) is creating a new market
opportunity for medtech, but medtech's
commercial model is too costly for ASCs, according

to analysts. To adapt, medtech companies should
consider new business models, like equity positions
in ASCs, in addition to lowering costs.309 The future
success of medtech companies will likely depend
on being proactive, in addition to leveraging recent
advancements in digital technologies.310

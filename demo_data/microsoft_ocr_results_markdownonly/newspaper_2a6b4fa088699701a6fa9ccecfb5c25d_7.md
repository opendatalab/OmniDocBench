We evaluated all known potential
impacts to the Highlands tiger beetle,
including the Act's five threat factors.
While these impacts were previously
believed to pose imminent or significant
threats to the species, and some may
have caused losses to individuals or
habitat, the updated information we
received regarding species' occurrence
and population size has improved our
understanding on how the stressors
affect the status of species. In our
current candidate assessment, we
evaluated the best available scientific
and commercial information, and
concluded that the species is resilient to
these stressors and that current impacts
to the species are not as strong as
previously believed. Approximately
43.4 percent of the existing potential
suitable habitat for the species is
protected conservation lands. While
fragmentation of the Lake Wales Ridge
scrub and sandhill habitats exists, 63
percent of the Highlands tiger beetle
populations occur on these protected
conservation lands, including three of
the largest known populations. These
lands are managed for the scrub habitat
and species, including the Highlands
tiger beetle, through government and
private partnership prescribed burn
programs, invasive species control, best
management practices, and enforcement
and protection of the resources.
Fragmentation of the habitat was
identified as a stressor compromising
the dispersal capabilities of Highlands
tiger beetle populations. However, the
new information on the number and
distribution of occupied sites and
population size indicates that the threat
to the dispersal capabilities of the
species is not as high as previously
reported. New sites have been identified
in four populations across the north to
south range of the species, and the Lake
Wales Ridge as a whole has areas of
open lands, remnant scrub and sandhill,
and patchworks of scrub roadside
habitat that can act as corridors or
"stepping stones" for Highlands tiger
beetle movement and flight, making
active migration to new sites or the
exchange of individuals between sites
feasible for this species. In addition,
storm winds, water flow, rafting
transport, and animals are possible
means of stochastic dispersal of
individual beetles.

As a result of the new information
and analysis, we no longer consider the
threats originally identified in our
previous 12-month finding for the
Highlands tiger beetle to be current or
foreseeable threats for the following
reasons: (1) The species is larger in
individual numbers and occurs in more

sites across its range than previously
documented; (2) the populations occur
primarily on protected conservation
lands; (3) more than half of the potential
suitable habitat for the species consists
of protected lands under conservation
management, with new conservation
lands and conservation banks acquired
in 2014; (4) the species occurs in 16
populations across 225,920 acres
[91,426 hectares] or 353 square miles
(920 square kilometers), and existing
unsurveyed suitable habitat occurs in
the species' range; (5) new survey
information has identified an increased
number of sites graded as "high" and
"good" quality habitat for the Highlands
tiger beetle; (6) the analysis reveals
annual prescribed burning schedules are
being implemented across the range of
the Highlands tiger beetle on
government and private conservation
lands; and (7) the stressors identified in
the 2015 candidate assessment,
including collections, occur at the
individual level but are not rising to the
level of population or species impacts.

Overall, current information from
additional surveys indicates an increase
in occupied sites with a large increase
in the number of beetles. Most threats
are being addressed through the
presence of large populations of the
species occurring on protected lands
and through the management actions
that occur on these lands. Any actual
impact from threats occurs at the
individual, not population or species,
level, and no impact, individually or
cumulatively, rises to the level that it
contributes to making the species meet
the definition of "threatened species" or
"endangered species."


# Finding

Based on our review of the best
available scientific and commercial
information pertaining to the Act's five
threat factors, we find that the current
stressors acting on the species and its
habitat are not of sufficient imminence,
intensity, or magnitude to make the
Highlands tiger beetle warrant listing
throughout the species' range at this
time. Because the distribution of the
species is relatively stable across its
range and stressors are similar
throughout the species' range, we found
no concentration of stressors that
suggests that the Highlands tiger beetle
may be in danger of extinction or likely
to become so in any portion of its range.
With the documentation of 16 newly
identified occupied sites, the
identification of improved habitat
quality, and the existing estimated adult
beetle count of over 10,000 individuals
in 56 sites, we find that Highlands tiger
beetle is no longer in danger of

extinction (endangered) or likely to
become endangered within the
foreseeable future (threatened)
throughout all of its range or any
portion of its range. Therefore, we find
that listing the Highlands tiger beetle as
an endangered or a threatened species is
not warranted throughout all or a
significant portion of its range at this
time, and consequently we are removing
this species from candidate status.

As a result of the Service's 2011
multidistrict litigation settlement with
the Center for Biological Diversity and
WildEarth Guardians, the Service is
required to submit a proposed listing
rule or a not-warranted 12-month
finding to the Federal Register by
September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered
Species Act Section 4 Deadline
Litigation, No. 10-377 (EGS), MDL
Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)).
for all 251 species that were included as
candidate species in the Service's
November 10, 2010, CNOR. This
document satisfies the requirements of
that settlement agreement for the
Highlands tiger beetle, and constitutes
the Service's 12-month finding on the
May 11, 2004, petition to list the
Highlands tiger beetle as an endangered
or threatened species. A detailed
discussion of the basis for this finding
can be found in the Highland tiger
beetle's species-specific assessment
form and other supporting documents
[see ADORESSES, above).


## Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirstii (Hirst Brothers' Panic Grass)


### Previous Federal Actions

In 1975, Panicum hirstif [i.e.,
Dichanthelium hirstii's former scientific
name; see Summary of Status Review,
below) was 1 of more than 3,000
vascular plants included in a
Smithsonian Institution report entitled
"Report on Endangered and Threatened
Plants of the United States" (Report)
that the Service subsequently treated as
a petition under the Act [40 FR 27824;
July 1, 1975). The Federal Register
notice indicated that P. hirstii and the
other plants were under consideration
for listing, and the notes of endangered
or threatened after each species' name
solely represented the views of the
authors of the Report. The Report
indicated that P. hirstif occurred in
Georgia and placed it in the endangered
category. The Service did not publish
another species notice of review until
1980.

In 1980, Panicum hirstif was
considered a Category 2 candidate
species (45 FR 82480; December 15,
1980). Category 2 candidate species
were identified as those taxa for which

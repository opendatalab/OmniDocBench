stability positively impacts small and
large producers by allowing them to
better anticipate the revenues their
raisins will generate.

There are some reporting.
recordkeeping and other compliance
requirements under the order. The
reporting and recordkeeping burdens
are necessary for compliance purposes
and for developing statistical data for
maintenance of the program. The
requirements are the same as those
applied in past seasons. Thus, this
action imposes no additional reporting
or recordkeeping burdens on either
small or large handlers. The forms
require information which is readily
available from handler records and
which can be provided without data
processing equipment or trained
statistical staff. The information
collection and recordkeeping
requirements have been previously
approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control
No. 0581-0178. As with other similar
marketing order programs, reports and
forms are periodically studied to reduce
or eliminate duplicate information
collection burdens by industry and
public sector agencies. In addition,
USDA has not identified any relevant
Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or
conflict with this rule.

Further, Committee and
subcommittee meetings are widely
publicized in advance and are held in
a location central to the production area.
The meetings are open to all industry
members, including small business
entities, and other interested persons
who are encouraged to participate in the
deliberations and voice their opinions
on topics under discussion.

An interim final rule concerning this
action was published in the Federal
Register on April 22, 2004 (69 FR
21695). Copies of the rule were mailed
to all Committee members and
alternates, the Raisin Bargaining
Association, handlers, and dehydrators.
In addition, the rule was made available
through the Internet by the Office of the
Federal Register and USDA. That rule
provided for a 60-day comment period
that ended on June 21, 2004. No
comments were received.

with fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop
marketing agreements and orders may

compliance guide should be sent to Jay

CONTACT section.

After consideration of all relevant
material presented, including the
information and recommendation

submitted by the Committee and other
available information, it is hereby found
that this rule, as hereinafter set forth,
will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.

### Fundamental Change in Asset Composition of a Bank

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, Treasury.
ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) is amending its
regulations to require a national bank to
obtain the approval of the OCC before
changing the composition of all, or
substantially all, of its assets (1) through
sales or other dispositions, or (2) after
having sold or disposed of all, or
substantially all, of its assets, through
subsequent purchases or other
acquisitions or other expansions of its
operations. The final rule provides that,
in the second case, the OCC will apply,
among other factors, the same factors as
it applies to the establishment of a de
novo bank. This new approval
requirement will enable the OCC to
better assess the bank's compliance with
applicable law and whether the
proposed change comports with safe
and sound banking practices.

DATES: Effective Date: October 1, 2004.

# SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


## I. Introduction

The OCC's current regulations at 12
CFR part 5 do not require the approval
of the OCC before a national bank
substantially changes the composition
of its assets through sale or other
disposition, nor do they require prior
OCC review or approval before a
national bank charter becomes a
"stripped" or "dormant" bank charter.
Likewise, our regulations do not address
a dormant national bank's increase in
asset size through purchases or
acquisitions to engage again in the
business of banking. On January 7, 2004,
we proposed to add to our regulations
a prior approval requirement for these
fundamental changes in a bank's asset
composition in order to address the
supervisory concerns raised by these
types of transactions. See 69 FR 892
(Jan. 7, 2004).

As described in the preamble to the
proposed rule, these concerns may
include increased operations risk,
increased concentration risk (especially
where asset composition changes as a
result of divestiture), and the ability of
bank management to implement the
new strategy successfully. In addition, a
dormant bank being revived may
propose to engage in activities that
significantly deviate or are a change
from the bank's original business plan
or operations. If ill conceived, poorly
planned, or inadequately executed,
these new activities can expose the bank
to imprudent levels of risk, with the
potential for adverse consequences for
the bank's financial condition and, in
the extreme situation, for its viability.
Even entry into lines of business that are
traditional for national banks may
present elevated levels of risk to a
particular bank if the bank expands
substantially or too quickly from a
dormant status, misjudges its markets,
or fails to ensure that bank management
and internal control systems keep pace
with the change. The preamble to the
proposal also noted that concerns raised
by the acquisition of a dormant bank by
a third party necessitates the need for
the OCC to thoroughly review the nature
of the services and products that might
be initiated by an acquiring entity.

For the reasons discussed in this
preamble, we are adopting in final form

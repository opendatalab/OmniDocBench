Fig. 1. General schematic of the third floor of the pilot-scale flour mill used for all experiments. The black boxes, white circles, and rectangles represent large
structural features on the third floor such as support columns, milling equipment, sifters, and large storage bins. The bioassay area positions are numbered 1-10.
The location of each aerosol application position is denoted as A1, A2, and A3 inside the gray squares. Aerosol application 4 was released from all three locations
A1, A2, and A3 (1/3 dose at each position). Source: Scheff et al. (2018), used by permission.

of the mill at an approximate 45° angle and applied using a sideways
sweeping motion toward the left and right sides of the floorspace. The
total aerosol application time was approximately 2-5 min, followed by
a 1-h exposure period. After the 1-h exposure, the air ventilation system
was turned on for approximately 10 min to remove any residual aerosol
particles that may be present in the ambient air. The next step was to
pick up all bioassay arenas that were exposed to the aerosol insecticide
treatment and replace with new bioassay arenas for the next aerosol
treatment, which took approximately 5-15 min. The aerosol application
position was changed after each treatment and each aerosol application
location was repeated twice for each aerosol formulation. Due to logis-
tical constraints of the milling facility (time available for testing) and
time required for each aerosol application the pyrethrin + pyriproxyfen
aerosol treatments were conducted first, followed by the pyrethrin +
methoprene aerosol treatments. Day 1 of testing had five trials, day 2 had
six trials, and day 3 had five trials, for a total of 16 aerosol applications.


# Bioassays

The T. confusum larvae used in the study were from a pesticide-
susceptible strain maintained at the United States Department of
Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Grain and
Animal Health Research (USDA-ARS-CGAHR, Manhattan, KS).
Tribolium confusum colonies are reared on 95% organic whole-
wheat flour and 5% brewer's yeast at 27°C, 60% RH, and 0:24
(L:D) h in an environmental chamber. These colonies have been
maintained at the USDA-ARS-CGAHR for more than 30 yr.

Testing arenas used in this study were individual 60 × 15 mm
(~22 cm2) Petri dishes partially filled with concrete and placed in-
side larger 150 x 20 mm (~137 cm2) plastic Petri dishes. Concrete
dishes were prepared based on Arthur (2015). Briefly, a dry powder
driveway patching material (Rockite, Hartline Product Co., Inc.,
Cleveland, OH) was mixed with water to create a thin slurry, poured
in the bottom of Petri dishes to a depth of ~0.5 cm, and held at am-
bient conditions for approximately 7 d. Inside each Petri dish, four
concrete arenas were placed. Three of the arenas were used in the
current study for residual bioassays at 2, 4, and 6 wk post-aerosol
treatment and contained no diet at time of exposure to aerosol. The
other arena was used as described by Scheff et al. (2018).

These groups of testing arenas were placed at ten different posi-
tions on the third floor (Fig. 1). Nine positions also had aerodynamic
particle sizer units (APS 3321, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN) placed to
collect data on aerosol particle concentration and size distribution.

Two additional testing arenas were placed on the first floor of the
mill during each aerosol treatment and served as untreated controls.
Arenas were placed in each of the four major corners of the mill
floor (arenas 4, 5, 8, 10). Bioassay arenas along walls were placed
approximately 0.5 m away from the wall (arenas 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10).
Bioassay arena 2 was placed in between two large pieces of milling
equipment and pneumatic conveying ducts. Bioassay arena 7 was
placed underneath a piece of milling equipment. Relative to the ap-
plication locations, bioassay arena 1 was placed directly in front of
aerosol application location 1 and bioassay arenas 9 and 4 were
placed next to aerosol application locations 2 and 3, respectively.

After aerosol applications, each bioassay arena was covered and
transported back to the USDA-ARS-CGAHR and held at 27℃, 60%
RH, and 0:24 (L:D) in an environmental chamber. At 2, 4, and 6 wk
post-aerosol application, five (3-4 wk old) T. confusum larvae along
with ~400 mg of diet were added to one concrete arena from each
bioassay arena position. Number of larvae available for bioassays
was limited, but five larvae per dish does provide sufficient reso-
lution to evaluate IGR effects on development. Larvae were exam-
ined twice weekly, up to 4 wk, for adult emergence. Emerged adults
were removed from dishes to prevent cannibalism.

At the end of 4 wk, all five individuals were classified as larvae,
pupae, or adults. Means and SEs were calculated for adult emergence
and data analyzed using statistical analysis software (version 9.4,
SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Adult emergence data were transformed to
angular values prior to analysis (Zar 2010) before using a three-way
analysis of variance based on bioassay position, application position,
and residual week as the main effects.


# Aerosol Dispersal Patterns

To assess the strength of the effect of the aerosol application, an
efficacy value index was created to convert the three morpho-
logical states (larvae, pupae, adult) to a single value for comparison
(Campbell et al. 2014). The efficacy index ranged from 1, the weakest
efficacy response with five adults, to 21, the strongest response with
five larvae. All of the index values with the corresponding numbers
of adults, pupae, and larvae indicated in brackets were the following:
1 [5,0,0], 2 [4,1,0], 3 [4,0,1], 4 [3,2,0], 5 [3,1,1], 6 [3,0,2], 7 [2,3,0],
8 [2,2,1], 9 [2,1,2], 10 [2,0,3], 11 [1,4,0], 12 [1,3,1], 13 [1,2,2], 14
[1,1,3], 15 [1,0,4], 16 [0,5,0], 17 [0,4,1], 18 [0,3,2], 19 [0,2,3], 20
[0,1,4], 21 [0,0,5].

# Ethical Questions

When you encounter an ethical decision and must choose a
course of action, ask yourself these important questions:

. Is it against the law? Does it violate company or professional
policies?

• Even if everyone is doing it, how would I feel if someone did
this to me?

· Am I sacrificing long-term benefits for short-term gains?


# The Ethical Decision-Making Process

Here are some steps to take if you find yourself in an ethical
dilemma:

1\. Identify the ethical dilemma.

2\. Discover alternative actions.

3\. Decide who might be affected.

4\. List the probable effects of the alternatives.

5\. Select the best alternative.

Using this process will enable you to make a more informed
ethical choice. Making an ethical decision involves more people
than just you.

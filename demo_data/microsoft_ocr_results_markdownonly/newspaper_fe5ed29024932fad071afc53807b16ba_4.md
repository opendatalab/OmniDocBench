There are essentially two broad
markets for raisins-domestic and
export. In recent years, both export and
domestic shipments have been
decreasing. Domestic shipments
decreased from a high of 204,805
packed tons during the 1990-91 crop
year to a low of 156,325 packed tons in
1999-2000. In addition, exports
decreased from 114,576 packed tons in
1991-92 to a low of 91,600 packed tons
in the 1999-2000 crop year.

In addition, the per capita
consumption of raisins has declined
from 2.07 pounds in 1988 to 1.48
pounds in 2002. This decrease is
consistent with the decrease in the per
capita consumption of dried fruits in
general, which is due to the increasing
availability of most types of fresh fruit
throughout the year.

While the overall demand for raisins
has been decreasing (as reflected in the
decline in commercial shipments).
production has been increasing.
Deliveries of NS dried raisins from
producers to handlers reached an all-
time high of 432,616 tons in the 2000-
01 crop year. This large crop was
preceded by two short crop years;
deliveries were 240,469 tons in 1998-99
and 299,910 tons in 1999-2000.
Deliveries for the 2000-01 crop year
soared to a record level because of
increased bearing acreage and yields.
Deliveries for the 2001-02 crop year
were 377,328 tons, and deliveries for the
2002-03 crop year were 388,010 tons.
Deliveries through the week ending June
19, 2004, of the current crop year were
at 296,625 tons. Three crop years of high
production and a large 2001-02 carryin
inventory have contributed to the
industry's burdensome supply of
raisins.

The order permits the industry to
exercise supply control provisions,
which allow for the establishment of

free and reserve percentages, and
establishment of a reserve pool. One of
the primary purposes of establishing
free and reserve percentages is to
equilibrate supply and demand. If raisin
markets are over-supplied with product,
producer prices will decline.

Raisins are generally marketed at
relatively lower price levels in the more
elastic export market than in the more
inelastic domestic market. This results
in a larger volume of raisins being
marketed and enhances producer
returns. In addition, this system allows
the U.S. raisin industry to be more
competitive in export markets.

To assess the impact that volume
control has on the prices producers
receive for their product, an
econometric model has been
constructed. The model developed is for
the purpose of estimating nominal
prices under a number of scenarios
using the volume control authority
under the Federal marketing order. The
price producers receive for the harvest
and delivery of their crop is largely
determined by the level of production
and the volume of carryin inventories.
The Federal marketing order permits the
industry to exercise supply control
provisions, which allow for the
establishment of reserve and free
percentages for primary markets, and a
reserve pool. The establishment of
reserve percentages impacts the
production that is marketed in the
primary markets.

The reserve percentage limits what
handlers can market as free tonnage.
Assuming the 30 percent reserve limits
the total free tonnage to 207,638 natural
condition tons (.70 x 296,625 tons
delivered through June 19, 2004) and
carryin is 129,345 natural condition
tons, and purchases from reserve total
66,740 natural condition tons (which
includes reserve raisins released

through both 10 plus 10 offers plus the
offer under $ 989.67(j)), then the total
free supply is estimated at 403,723
natural condition tons. The econometric
model estimates prices to be $63 per ton
higher than under an unregulated
scenario. This price increase is
beneficial to all producers regardless of
size and enhances producers' total
revenues in comparison to no volume
control. Establishing a reserve allows
the industry to help stabilize supplies in
both domestic and export markets,
while improving returns to producers.

Free and reserve percentages are
established by varietal type, and usually
in years when the supply exceeds the
trade demand by a large enough margin
that the Committee believes volume
regulation is necessary to maintain
market stability. Accordingly, in
assessing whether to apply volume
regulation or, as an alternative, not to
apply such regulation, it has been
determined that volume regulation is
warranted this season for only one of
the nine raisin varietal types defined
under the order.

The free and reserve percentages
established by this rule release the full
trade demand and apply uniformly to
all handlers in the industry, regardless
of size. For NS raisins, with the
exception of the 1998-99 crop year,
small and large raisin producers and
handlers have been operating under
volume regulation percentages every
year since 1983-84. There are no known
additional costs incurred by small
handlers that are not incurred by large
handlers. While the level of benefits of
this rulemaking are difficult to quantify,
the stabilizing effects of volume
regulation impact small and large
handlers positively by helping them
maintain and expand markets even
though raisin supplies fluctuate widely
from season to season. Likewise, price

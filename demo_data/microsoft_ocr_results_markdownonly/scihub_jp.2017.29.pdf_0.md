OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess and modify an existing decision aid and field-test decision coaching with the
modified aid during consultations with parents facing potential delivery at 23 to 24 weeks gestation.

STUDY DESIGN: International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi) scoring deficits, multi-stakeholder group
feedback and a-testing guided modifications. Feasibility/acceptability were assessed. The Decisional Conflict Scale was used to
measure participants' decisional conflict before (T1) and immediately after (T2) the consultation.

RESULTS: IPDASi assessment of the existing aid (score 11/35) indicated it required updated data, more information and a palliative
care description. Following modification, IPDASi score increased to 26/35. Twenty subjects (12 pregnancies) participated in field-
testing; 15 completed all questionnaires. Most participants (89%) would definitely recommend this form of consultation. Decisional
conflict scores decreased (P < 0.001) between T1 (52±25) and T2 (10±16).

CONCLUSION: Field testing demonstrated that consultations using the aid with decision coaching were feasible, reduced
decisional conflict and may facilitate shared decision-making.

## INTRODUCTION

With the prioritizing of patient-centred care, there has been
increasing emphasis on patient involvement during decision-
making processes. Shared decision-making (SDM) involves a
collaborative discussion between healthcare professionals and
patients to come to an informed, preference-matched decision.1
Recent statements from national organizations2,3 encourage the
use of SDM with decisions at the neonatal limit of viability to
enhance parental involvement.

In clinical settings, patient decision aids (PtDA) can facilitate
SDM.4 They support the participation of patients in decision
making about health care options by improving patient knowl-
edge, involvement and values-choice agreement.5,6 Decision
coaching, where trained coaches provide patients with individua-
lized, non-directive guidance,4 is often used in conjunction with
PtDA and has similar benefits.4,7,8

When facing the potential delivery of an extremely premature
infant at 23 to 24 weeks gestational age (GA), parents often face
the choice of having the healthcare team provide either intensive
or palliative care for their infant. Although evidence strongly
supports the use of PtDA and decision coaching to support
patients in decision-making, minimal evidence exists regarding
their use with parents making a life or death decision for their
unborn infant. In 2012, Guillen et al.9 detailed the systematic
development and pre-testing of a PtDA for use when prenatally
counseling parents facing such a decision. The PtDA was
understandable during simulated consultations and increased
parental knowledge; however, it lacked standardized
assessment10,11 and was not evaluated in real-life situations. If a
PtDA does not meet these certification criteria, it can negatively
affect the SDM process during clinical use.11

Given continued parental dissatisfaction12 and healthcare
professionals' difficulties13 with consultations at the limit of
viability, the objectives of this study were to: (1) assess and, if
necessary, modify an existing PtDA9 for use in our institution and
(2) field-test decision coaching with the PtDA with parents facing
potential delivery at 23 or 24 weeks GA to evaluate the feasibility
and acceptability of using a PtDA in this situation and to
determine the effect on parental decisional conflict.


## METHODS

The local ethics review boards approved the study. One author (GM)
received permission from its developers to modify an existing PtDA9 (six
decision cards and accompanying four page script).

The study was conducted at The Ottawa Hospital, General Campus, and
the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. The study included three main
steps as follows: (1) assessment, (2) modification and a-testing and (3) field
(β) testing of decision coaching with the modified PtDA.


### Assessment of existing PtDA

Four authors (GM, S Ding, S Dunn and TD) performed independent
assessments of the existing PtDA9 using the International Patient Decision
Aid Standards instrument11 (IPDASi, v4.0) that provides a framework to
certify decision support tools through evaluating and improving their
content, development and implementation. Nine of the 44 IPDASi items
were not applied as the PtDA did not involve a screening test.11 A PtDA
must receive 'yes' for all qualifying criteria to be considered a PtDA, a score
greater than three on all certification criteria for IPDAS certification and
scores >3 on quality items to indicate better PtDA quality. Scoring
differences were discussed until consensus was achieved.14 Unmet criteria
allowed identification of the existing PtDA's shortcomings.

To complement the assessment, an existing multi-stakeholder working
group (that included parents of extremely premature infants) completed a
survey to rank health-related factors important to the decision that could

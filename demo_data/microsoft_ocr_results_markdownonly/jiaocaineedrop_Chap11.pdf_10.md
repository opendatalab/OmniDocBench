The Arab armies were successful for several
reasons. First, they were united in the belief that
they had a religious duty to spread Islam. The
Islamic state, therefore, saw the conquests as a
jihad (jih·HAHD), or holy struggle to bring Islam
to other lands. In addition, continual warfare
between the Byzantines and the Persians had weak-
ened both of their empires and made them open to
Arab attacks. Still another factor was the attempt of
Byzantine and Persian rulers to impose religious
unity on their peoples. Because of persecution,
members of unofficial religions in both empires
readily accepted Muslim rule.


# Divisions Within Islam

While Muslim armies were achieving military
success, rival groups fought for the caliphate, or the
office of caliph. The struggle began when Ali,
Muhammad's son-in-law, became the fourth caliph
in A.D. 656. One of Ali's powerful rivals was
Mu'awiyah (moo•UH•wee.uh), the governor of
Syria. Mu'awiyah carried out conquests in Egypt

and Iraq, steadily weakening Ali's hold on the
caliphate. In A.D. 661, Ali was murdered by a disil-
lusioned follower, and Mu'awiyah became the first
caliph of the powerful Umayyad (oo.MY•uhd)
dynasty. Ali's son Husayn (hoo·SAYN), however,
refused to accept Umayyad rule and continued the
struggle. In A.D. 680, Husayn and many of his fol-
lowers were massacred by Umayyad troops in a
battle at Karbala in present-day Iraq.

The murders of Ali and Husayn led to a signif-
icant division in the Islamic world. The majority of
Muslims, known as the Sunni (SU·nee), or "fol-
lowers of the way," believed that the caliph was pri-
marily a leader, not a religious authority. They also
claimed that any devout Muslim could serve in the
office with the acceptance of the people. However,
the Shiite, the smaller group of Muslims who fol-
lowed Ali and Husayn, believed that the caliphate
should be held only by descendants of Muhammad
through his daughter Fatimah and her husband Ali.
Shiite Muslims stressed the spiritual, rather than
political, aspects of Islamic leadership. Because of

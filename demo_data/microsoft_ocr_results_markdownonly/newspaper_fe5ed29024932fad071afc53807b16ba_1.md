The Committee's meetings were
widely publicized throughout the sweet
onion industry and all interested
persons were invited to attend the
meetings and participate in Committee
deliberations on all issues. Like all
Committee meetings, the December 8,
2003, and the February 10, 2004,
meetings were public meetings and all
entities, both large and small, were able
to express their views.

An interim final rule concerning this
action was published in the Federal
Register on April 26, 2004 [69 FR
22377). Copies of the rule were mailed
by the Committee's staff to all
Committee members and Walla Walla
sweet onion handlers. In addition, the
rule was made available through the
Internet by the Office of the Federal
Register and the USDA. That rule
provided a 60-day comment period
which ended June 25, 2004. No
comments were received.

with fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop
marketing agreements and orders may

compliance guide should be sent to Jay
Guerber at the previously mentioned

CONTACT section.

After consideration of all relevant
material presented, including the
Committee's recommendation, and
other information, it is found that
finalizing the interim final rule, without
change, as published in the Federal
Register (69 FR 22377, April 26, 2004)
will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule
is issued under Marketing Agreement
and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989),

both as amended, regulating the
handling of raisins produced from
grapes grown in California, hereinafter
referred to as the "order." The order is
effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as
amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674). hereinafter
referred to as the "Act."

USDA is issuing this rule in
conformance with Executive Order
12866.

This rule has been reviewed under
Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice
Reform. Under the order provisions now
in effect, final free and reserve
percentages may be established for
raisins acquired by handlers during the
crop year. This rule continues to
establish final free and reserve
percentages for NS raisins for the 2003-
04 crop year, which began August 1,
2003, and ends July 31, 2004. This rule
will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule.

The Act provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before
parties may file suit in court. Under
section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any
handler subject to an order may file
with USDA a petition stating that the
order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with
the order is not in accordance with law
and request a modification of the order
or to be exempted therefrom. Such
handler is afforded the opportunity for
a hearing on the petition. After the
hearing USDA would rule on the
petition. The Act provides that the
district court of the United States in any
district in which the handler is an
inhabitant, or has his or her principal
place of business, has jurisdiction to
review USDA's ruling on the petition,
provided an action is filed not later than
20 days after the date of the entry of the
ruling.

This rule continues in effect final
volume regulation percentages for 2003-
04 crop NS raisins covered under the
order. The volume regulation
percentages are 70 percent free and 30
percent reserve, and were established
through an interim final rule published
on April 22, 2004 (69 FR 21695). Free
tonnage raisins may be sold by handlers
to any market. Reserve raisins must he
held in a pool for the account of the
Committee and are disposed of through
various programs authorized under the
order. For example, reserve raisins may
be sold by the Committee to handlers for
free use or to replace part of the free
tonnage raisins they exported; used in
diversion programs; carried over as a
hedge against a short crop; or disposed
of in other outlets not competitive with
